MARGE
Oh, careful, Homer!

HOMER
There's no time to be careful, we're late.

They enter the hall. A class is singing "Oh, Little Town of Bethlehem".

MARGE
Sorry, excuse me, pardon me, sorry.

HOMER
Hey Norman, how is it going? So you got dragged out here too, huh?

MARGE
Excuse me, excuse me.

HOMER
How are you doing, Fred? Yeah. Excuse me. (he steps on someone's feet) Oops, pardon my galoshes.

The audience applaud. Principal Skinner comes on stage.

SKINNER
Wasn't that wonderful? And now, the Santa's of many lands, as presented by the entire second grade class.

MARGE
Oh, Lisa's class.

GIRL
Frohlich Weihnachten. That's German for Merry Christmas. In Germany Santa servant Bruprecht gives presents to good children and whipping rods to the parents of bad ones.

The audience applaud.

BOY
Merry Kurisumasu I am Hotiashi a Japanese priest who acts like Santa Clause. I have eyes in the back of my head so children better behave when I'm nearby.

He turns around to reveal glasses (with eyes attached) on the back of his head. One of the eyes pops out, and the crowd gasp, then applaud.

MR. LARGO
Now presenting Lisa Simpson as Towanga, the Santa Clause of the South Seas.

HOMER
Oh it's Lisa! That's ours.

Lisa, wearing a witch doctor mask and grass skirt, juggles flaming torches.

SKINNER
Ah, the fourth grade will now favor us with a melody... er... medley of Holiday favorites.

The class sing Jingle Bells...

CLASS
Dancing through the snow,
In a one-horse open sleigh,
O'er the fields we go,
Dancing all the way, ho ho ho...

MARGE
Isn't Bart sweet, Homer? He sings like an angel.

...but Bart creates his own lyrics.

BART
Jingle Bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg. The Batmobile broke its wheel, the Joker got awa-aah!

He is pulled off stage by Skinner. The scene fades from Homer looking bored to Homer looking even more bored.

SKINNER
The fifth grade will now favor us with a scene form Charles... uh... Dickens'... A Christmas Carol.

HOMER
Oh, How many grades does this school have?

At the Simpsons' home, Marge is writing a letter. We hear her reading the letter in her head.

MARGE
"Dear friends of the Simpson family. We had some sadness and some gladness this year. First, the sadness: our little cat Snowball was unexpectedly run over and went to kitty heaven. But we bought a new little cat Snowball II, so I guess life goes on. Speaking of live going on, Grandpa is still with us, feisty as ever. Maggie is walking by herself, Lisa got straight A's, and Bart... well, we love Bart. The magic of the season has touched us all."

HOMER
Marge! Haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?

MARGE
"Homer sends his love. Happy Holidays..."

HOMER
Marge!

MARGE
"...the Simpsons."

HOMER
Marge! Where's the extension cord?

MARGE
For heaven sakes, Homer, its in the utility drawer.

HOMER
Sorry I'm just a big kid. I love Christmas so much.

He opens the drawer and finds that the extension cord is tangled up.

HOMER
D'oh!

MARGE
All right, children, let me have those letters. I'll send them to Santa's workshop at the North Pole.

BART
Oh please, there's only one fat guy that brings us presents and his name ain't Santa.

MARGE
(looking at Lisa's list) A Pony? Oh Lisa, you have asked for that for the past three years, and I keep telling you that Santa cant fit a pony in his sleigh. Cant you take a hint?

LISA
But I really want a pony and I have been really really good this year.

MARGE
Oh, dear. Maybe Bart is a little more realistic. (reading) A tattoo?!

HOMER
A what?

BART
Yeah, they're cool, and they last for the rest of your life.

MARGE
You will not be getting a tattoo for Christmas.

HOMER
Yeah, if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.

BART
All right!

MARGE
Homer!

The phone rings. Homer answers it.

HOMER
Hello?

PATTY
Marge please.

HOMER
Who is this?

PATTY
May I please speak to Marge?

HOMER
This is her sister isn't it?

PATTY
Is Marge there?

HOMER
Who shall I say is calling?

PATTY
Marge please.

HOMER
(handing the phone to Marge) It's your sister.

MARGE
Oh, hello.

PATTY
Hello Marge, its Patty. Selma and I couldn't be more excited about seeing our baby sister for Christmas Eve.

MARGE
Well, Homer and I are looking forward to your visit too.

Homer makes a strangling sound.

PATTY
Somehow I doubt that Homer is excited. Of all the men you could have married, I don't know why you picked one who is always so rude to...

The scene fades to outside. Homer is putting lights up. After connecting the last one he falls off the roof.

BART
Good one, Dad.

HOMER
Okay kids prepare to be dazzled. Marge, turn on the juice! What do you think kids?

The lights are pretty pathetic.

LISA
Nice try, Dad.

BART
Ugh.

FLANDERS
(to Todd) Hold your horses, son. (calling from next door) Hey, Simpson!

HOMER
What is it, Flanders?

FLANDERS
Do you think this looks okay?

BART
Whoa, neat-oh!

HOMER
Its too bright. (muttering) Flanders, what a big show off.

 

ACT TWO
The family is at the breakfast table.

MARGE
Kids, do you want to go Christmas shopping?

LISA
I do!

BART
All right, the mall!

MARGE
Go get your money.

HOMER
Tell us, Marge, where have you been hiding the Christmas money?

MARGE
Oh, I have my secrets. Turn around. (She pulls a jar of money out of her hair.) You can look now.

HOMER
Oh, big jar this year!

At the mall, Marge and Lisa are looking at the trains and Bart is looking at some tattoos. Bart imagines himself with a "Mother" tattoo.

MARGE
Oh, Bart that's so sweet. Its the best present a mother could get, and it makes you look so dangerous.

Bart decides to go into the store and get one.

BART
One "Mother" please.

TATTOO GUY
Wait a minute. How old are you?

BART
Twenty one, sir.

TATTOO GUY
Get in the chair.

At the power plant, Homer is checking the equipment. Everything is in order, even one with a red flashing light. An announcement comes over the tannoy.

SMITHERS
Attention all personnel. Please keep working during the following announcement.

The employees stop to eat donuts.

SMITHERS
And now, our boss and friend, Mr. Burns.

MR. BURNS
Hello. I'm proud to announce that we've been able to increase safety here at the power plant without increasing the cost to the consumer or affecting management pay raises. However, for you semi-skilled workers, there will be no Christmas bonuses. Oh, and one more thing Merry Christmas.

HOMER
Oh, thank god for the big jar.

Back at the mall.

MARGE
Where's that Bart?

Bart's screams can be heard. Marge walks into the Tattoo store, and is shocked to see Bart getting a tattoo with the word "Moth" on it. She yanks him out of the chair, and takes him next door to a doctor that can remove the tattoo.

BART
But Mom, I thought you would like it!

DOCTOR
Yes, Mrs. Simpson, we can remove your sons tattoo. Its a simple routine involving lasers.

BART
Cool!

DOCTOR
However, it is expensive we must insist on a cash payment up front.

MARGE
Cash?

DOCTOR
Mm-hmm.

MARGE
Thank god for Homers Christmas bonus.

The doctor turns the laser on.

BART
Aye Carumba!

DOCTOR
Now, what ever you do boy, don't squirm. You don't want this sucker near your eye or your groin.

Back at home. Lisa touches Bart's arm.

BART
Ow! Quit it. (she does it again) Ow! Quit it. (she does it again) Ow! Quit it (Maggie touches his arm) Ow! Quit it.

Homer walks into the room.

HOMER
Hey, what's this? (he touches Bart's arm)

BART
Ow! Quit it. It used to be a real boss tattoo.

LISA
But Mom had to spend all the Christmas money to have it surgically removed.

Marge shows him the empty jar.

HOMER
Oh, its true! The jar is empty! Oh my god, we're ruined. Christmas is canceled, no presents for anyone.

MARGE
Don't worry Homer we'll just have to stretch your Christmas bonus even farther this year.

HOMER
Aah!

MARGE
Homer?

HOMER
Oh, yeah... my Christmas bonus. Hee hee... how silly of me. This will be best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had!

He goes outside, and looks at his measly decorations, then Flanders' extravagant decorations. He hangs his head in shame.

 

ACT THREE
Homer and Marge are in bed.

MARGE
I get the feeling there's something you haven't told me Homer.

HOMER
Huh? Oh, I love you Marge.

MARGE
Oh, you tell me that all the time.

HOMER
Good, because I do love you. I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that wont set off that horrible beeping.

MARGE
Well, I think it does have something to do with your Christmas bonus. I keep asking for it, but...

HOMER
Marge, let me be honest with you.

MARGE
Yes?

HOMER
Well... I... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year!

MARGE
Well, sure, okay.

She hands him a piece of paper. Homer smiles in a big grin, and Marge switches the lights out. Homer's eyes and teeth can still be seen.

Homer is at the store, shopping.

HOMER
Marge, Marge, mmm, lets see... oh, look! Pantyhose! Practical and alluring. A six pack, oh, only 4.99. Ooh, pads of paper. I bet Bart could think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie... oh look, a little squeak toy! It says its for dogs, but she cant read.

Outside, Homer runs into Flanders and they both drops their boxes.

FLANDERS
Oh, ho ho Simpson, its you.

HOMER
Hello Flanders.

FLANDERS
Oh my, what a little mess we've got here. Well, which ones are yours and
which ones are mine?

HOMER
Well, lets see.

FLANDERS
(picking up boxes) Well this one's mine, and this one's mine. This ones mine, and...

HOMER
They're all yours!

TODD
Hey, Mr. Simpson. You dropped your pork chop.

HOMER
(snatching it) Gimme that!

FLANDERS
Well, happy holidays Simpson!

TODD
(walking off) Gee Dad, this is going to be the best Christmas ever.

FLANDERS
You bet!

Homer is at Moe's Tavern.

MOE
What's the matter, Homer? Did someone leave a lump of coal in your stocking? You've been sitting there sucking on a beer all day long.

HOMER
So?

MOE
So, its Christmas. (He hands Homer a candy cane)

HOMER
Thanks Moe.

Barney enters.

BARNEY
Drinks all around!

HOMER
What's with the crazy get up, Barn?

BARNEY
I got me a part time job working as a Santa down at the mall.

HOMER
Wow, can I do that?

BARNEY
I dunno, they're pretty selective. (he belches)

Homer is being interviewed for the Santa job.

MANAGER
Do you like children?

HOMER
What do you mean, all the time? Even when they're nuts? (the manager frowns at him) Uh, I certainly do!

MANAGER
Welcome aboard, Simpson. Pending your completion of our training program that is.

Homer is in a classroom, filled with Santa look-a-likes.

SANTAS
Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho!

Homer raises his hand.

TEACHER
What is it now, Simpson?

HOMER
Uh, when do we get paid?

TEACHER
Not a dime till Christmas Eve. Now, from the top.

SANTAS
Ho ho ho! Ho ho ho!

Later in class.

HOMER
Um, Dasher... Dancer...

TEACHER
Mm-hmm.

HOMER
Prancer...

TEACHER
Mm-hmm.

HOMER
Nixon... Comet... Cupid... Donna Dixon?

TEACHER
Sit down, Simpson.

Later again. The teacher is sat on Homer's lap.

HOMER
And what would you like, little boy?

TEACHER
You're not really Santa, tubby.

HOMER
Why you little...! (he tries to strangle the manager)

TEACHER
Hey! No Homer, if such an emergency arises just tell them Santa is very busy this time of year, and you're one of his helpers.

HOMER
D'oh, I knew that one too.

Back at home. Homer has just arrived back.

MARGE
Homer, why are you 7 hours late?

HOMER
Not a word Marge, I'm heading straight for the tub.

MARGE
But Homer, my sisters are here, don't you want to say hello?

Homer shudders.

BART & LISA
Daddy, Daddy!

BART
Welcome home!

LISA
Where so glad to see you!

HOMER
Why? Oh yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma, how was your trip.

PATTY
Fine.

HOMER
You both look well.

SELMA
Thank you.

HOMER
Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.

PATTY
It's Christmas? You wouldn't know it around here.

HOMER
And why is that?

SELMA
Well, for one thing there's no tree.

HOMER
Well I was just on my way out to get one!

LISA
Can we go too, Dad?

BART
Yeah, can we?

HOMER
No!!

Homer drives around, looking for Christmas trees. He passes signs that read "All trees $75'', "Trees $60 and up'' and "Christmas trees, slightly irregular, $45''. Finally, he goes to an area marked "No trespassing" and cuts down his own tree. A guard chases after him.

GUARD
Hey you! What do you think you're doing?

HOMER
Uh-oh.

GUARD
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

He shoots several shots off a gun as Homer drives off. Back at the house, the family admire the tree.

HOMER
So, what do you think, kids? Beauty, isn't it?

BART
Wow!

LISA
Way to go, Dad!

SELMA
Why is there a birdhouse in it?

HOMER
Oh, that's an ornament.

PATTY
Do I smell gun powder?

At the mall, a boy sits on Homer's lap.

BOY
And then I want some Robotoids, and then I want a gook monster, and I want I great big...

HOMER
Ah son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you already got something much more important: a decent home, and a loving father that would do anything for you. Hey, I cant afford lunch, give me a bite of that donut.

Bart, Milhouse and Lewis watch Homer from the gantry.

MILHOUSE
Get a load at that quote-unquote Santa.

LEWIS
I cant believe those kids are falling for it.

BART
Hey Milhouse, I dare you to sit on his lap.

MILHOUSE
Oh yeah? Well I dare you to yank his beard off.

BART
Ah Touché!

Back down below.

GIRL
I hope you feel better, Santa.

HOMER
Oh, I will when Mrs. Clause's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening kid.

Bart is up next.

BART
Hey Santa, what's shakin' man?

HOMER
What's your name Bart... ner... uh, little partner?

BART
I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?

HOMER
(angrily) I'm jolly old Saint Nick.

BART
Oh yeah, we'll just see about that. (Bart pulls his beard off)

HOMER
D'oh!

BART
Homer!

HOMER
I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop little boy! (aside) Cover for me Alphy.

BART
Don't kill me Dad, I didn't know it was you!

HOMER
Nobody knows! Its a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas I'd do anything.

BART
I'll say. You must really love us to sink so low.

HOMER
Well lets not get mushy son, I still have a job to do. (leaves the workshop) Hey hey! Santa's back! Ho ho (he bangs his head) D'oh! Dammit!

Homer is getting paid.

HOMER
Ah, son, one day you're going to learn the satisfaction of payday - receiving a big fat check for a job well done.

CASHIER
Simpson, Homer. Here you go.

HOMER
Come on son lets go cash this baby and get presents for... aah! Thirteen bucks? Hey wait a minute!

CASHIER
That's right. $120 gross, less Social Security...

HOMER
Yeah...

CASHIER
Less unemployment insurance...

HOMER
But...

CASHIER
Less Santa training...

HOMER
Santa training?

CASHIER
Less costume purchase...

HOMER
Wait a minute...

CASHIER
Less beard rental...

HOMER
But...

CASHIER
Less Christmas club.

HOMER
But...

CASHIER
See you next year.

HOMER
Ohh...

BART
Come on dad lets go home.

HOMER
Thirteen bucks? You can't get anything for thirteen bucks.

BARNEY
All right, thirteen big ones! Springfield Downs, here I come!

HOMER
What?

BARNEY
You heard me, I'm going to the dog track. I got a hot little puppy in the fourth race. Want to come?

HOMER
Sorry Barney, I may be a total wash out of a father but I'm not going to take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve.

BARNEY
Come on Simpson, the dogs name is Whirlwind. Ten to one shot. Money in the bank.

HOMER
Uh-uh.

BART
Aw, come on Dad. This could be the miracle that saves the Simpsons' Christmas. If TV has taught me anything, its that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to Charlie Brown, it happened to the Smurfs, and it going to happen to us.

HOMER
Well, okay lets go. (walking off) Who's Tiny Tim?

At the Simpsons home. Everyone is watching the Happy Little Elves.

ELF #1
Hey, Moley, do you think Santa will be able to find Elf County under all this snow?

ELF #2
I doubt it, Bubbles. We'll be sad little elves this Christmas.

LISA
Oh no!

GRAMPA
Oh Brother.

SELMA
Where's your husband?

PATTY
Yeah, its getting late.

MARGE
Well, he said he went caroling with Bart.

At the dog track. Bart is on Barney's shoulders.

BART & BARNEY
We're in the money! We're in the money!

HOMER
I can't believe I'm doing this.

They walk past a child with his father.

KID
Can we open our presents now, Dad?

FATHER
You know the tradition, son, not till the eighth race.

HOMER
Hey Barney, which one is Whirlwind?

BARNEY
Number six. That's our lucky dog right over there. He won he last five races.

HOMER
What, that scrawny little bag of bones?

BART
Come on Dad, they're all scrawny little bags of bones.

HOMER
Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.

ANNOUNCER
Attention racing fans, we have a late scratch in the fourth race. Number eight Sir Galahad will be replaced by Santa's Little Helper once again Sir Galahad has been replaced by Santa's Little Helper.

HOMER
Bart did you here that? What a name - Santa's Little Helper. It's a sign. It's an omen.

BART
It's a coincidence, Dad.

HOMER
(at the betting desk) What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?

MAN
Ninety nine to to one.

HOMER
Wow! Ninety nine times thirteen equals... Merry Christmas!

BART
I got a bad feeling about this.

HOMER
Don't you believe in me son?

BART
Uh...

HOMER
Come on boy, sometimes your face is all that keep me going.

BART
Oh... go for it, Dad.

HOMER
That's my boy! (to the clerk) Everything on Santa's little Helper.

Back at home. The Happy Little Elves reaches a happy end.

ELVES
Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray! Hip-hip-hooray!

LISA
Yay!

GRAMPA
Unadulterated pap.

PATTY
It's almost nine o'clock.

SELMA
Where is Homer anyway?

PATTY
It's typical of the big doofus to spoil it all.

LISA
What Aunt Patty?

PATTY
Oh nothing, dear. I'm just trashing your father.

LISA
Well, I wish that you wouldn't. Because aside from the fact that he has the same frailties as all human beings, he's the only father I have. Therefore, he is my model of manhood, and my estimation of him will govern the prospects of my adult relationships. So I hope you beer in mind that any knock at him is a knock at me, and I am far to young to cartoon myself against such onslaughts.

PATTY
Mmm-hmm. Go watch your cartoon show, dear.

Back at the dog track.

HOMER
Come on Bart, kiss the ticket for good luck. Not that we need it!

ANNOUNCER
Here comes Shirley the mechanical rabbit. And they're off. Around the first turn, it's Whirlwind in the lead, and coming up on the left is Quadruped followed by Dog of War and Fido.

Bart and Homer cheer for Santa's Little Helper.

ANNOUNCER
Dog of War coming up fast on the outside. And in last place... is Santa's Little Helper.

HOMER
D'oh! Oh...

BART
Don't worry Dad. Maybe this is just for suspense before the miracle happens.

HOMER
Come on you stupid dog.

BART
Come on boy.

ANNOUNCER
Whirlwind wins by a country mile followed by Dog of War.

HOMER
D'oh!

BART
It doesn't seem possible, but I guess TV has betrayed me.

HOMER
I don't want leave till I dog finishes. (long pause) Ah forget it, lets go.

Outside the dog track, Bart and Homer looks for a winning ticket.

HOMER
Find any winners son?

BART
Sorry, Dad.

Barney drives up, with a woman in the passenger seat.

BARNEY
Hey Simpson, what did I tell you - Whirlwind. Lets go Daria.

They drive off. A man starts shouting.

MAN
Beat it! Scram, get lost! You came in last for the last time!

BART
Look Dad, its Santa's Little Helper.

MAN
And don't come back!

The dog runs towards Homer & Bart.

HOMER
Oh no you don't! No, no, get away from me! Uh-uh.

BART
Oh, can we keep him dad please.

HOMER
But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's... (the dog licks Homer) ... a Simpson.

Back at the Simpson home.

MARGE
Mmm... maybe we should call the police.

PATTY
He'll sober up.

SELMA
Yeah, come staggering home.

PATTY
Uh-huh. Smelling like cheap perfume.

Homer & Bart enter.

MARGE
Homer!

GRAMPA
(waking up) What? Wha?

HOMER
Look everybody, I have a confession to make.

PATTY
This should be good.

HOMER
I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried to not let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did...

BART
Hey everybody, look what we got!

LISA
A dog! All right dad!

MARGE
God bless him.

LISA
So love at first sight is possible.

BART
And if he runs away he'll be easy to catch.

MARGE
This is the best gift of all, Homer.

HOMER
It is?

MARGE
Yes, something to share our love. And frighten prowlers.

LISA
What's he's name?

HOMER
Number 8. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.

The family all pet the dog. The moment is captured in a snapshot, with "Happy Holidays from The Simpsons" written on it.

The Simpsons family then sing "Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer" (a la Simpson) over the closing credits. Grampa is sat at the piano. Bart and Lisa interrupt the song.

ALL
Rudolph the Red nosed reindeer,
Had a very shiny nose,
And if you ever saw it,
You would even say it glows.

BART
Like a light bulb!

HOMER
Bart!

ALL
All of the other reindeer,
Used to laugh and call him names.

LISA
Like Schnozzola!

HOMER
Lisa!

ALL
They never let poor Rudolph,
Join in any reindeer games.

BART
Like strip poker!

HOMER
I'm warning you two!

ALL
Then one foggy Christmas Eve,
Santa came to say,

MARGE
Take it Homer.

HOMER
Er... Rudolph, get your nose over here,
So you can drive my sleigh... today...

GRAMPA
Oh, Homer...

ALL
Then all the reindeer loved him,
And they shouted out with glee,
Rudolph the red nose reindeer,
You'll go down in history!

BART
Like Attila the Hu- ught urk!

HOMER
You little... grrrr!!



##### SET: 2 ####

20th Century Fox ident. From halfway through, Ralph Wiggum sings along with the tune.

RALPH
Da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-daaa!

The logo fades to black-and-white and scrolls off-screen. The Moon comes into shot. A spacecraft flies over the surface and lands on the Moon, to the music from "2001: A Space Odyssey". Scratchy climbs down the side of the craft, making his way onto the Moon's surface. He takes big strides across to an American flag, next to which Itchy is standing.

SCRATCHY
We come in peace, for cats and mice everywhere.

Itchy removes the flagpole from the surface and stabs Scratchy in the chest several times; Scratchy screams each time. Itchy hits him over the head several times, breaking his space helmet and causing his head to expand and pop. Itchy points and laughs at him, then goes back to the ship and flies back to Earth.

A newspaper, The Washington Post, spins into view. It reads, "MOUSE HERO RETURNS" with the subtitle, "Did Everything To Save Cat". A second headline reads, "A WIDOW MOURNS".

A parade fills the street with blue mice not unlike Itchy, who rides in a car. "Itchy for President" and "Itchy/Hillary '08" banners can be seen.

ITCHY
Hey, how you doin'? Good to see ya. Thanks for coming out.

It seems Itchy does become President. One night he is eating cheese n the White House and hears Scratchy's voice.

SCRATCHY
(echoing) Itchy... Itchy...

Itchy looks up at the Moon with binoculars. Scratchy is still there, lying on the ground; he holds up a placard, reading "I'm Telling". After much deliberation, Itchy decides what to do - launch missiles at the moon. He opens up a secret government machine and sets it to "Accidental Launch".

Hundreds of rockets are fired towards the Moon. As they close in on him, Scratchy screams with his mouth wide open. All the rockets enter his mouth and swell him up. One final rocket flies in close, stops, then opens a compartment in the front. A boot comes out and kicks Scratchy, causing him to explode into pieces.

Homer's head appears in front of the screen.

HOMER
Boring!

LISA
Dad! We can't see the movie.

We see that the family are in a movie theatre, along with many other Springfield citizens.

HOMER
I can't believe we're paying to see something we get on TV for free. (gesturing) If you ask me everyone in this theatre is a giant sucker. (points at camera) Especially you!

Homer's image fades as the traditional Simpsons opening begins...

CHORUS
The Simpsons...

Professor Frink flies a contraption across the screen from right to left, dragging a large banner saying "MOVIE".

FRINK
(singing) Movie! On the big screen...

The camera flies through the 'O' of 'MOVIE' and we take a trip through Springfield. We pass various scenery before entering Mr. Burns' mansion. Smithers applies toothpaste to Burns' toothbrush, causing him to fall over from the weight.

Past Moe's and down the street is the Kwik-E-Mart, where Apu is changing the expiry date on a carton of milk.

Outside Springfield Elementary School, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph hoist Martin up the flagpole by his underpants. They salute as Martin screams. Inside his classroom, Bart writes "I WILL NOT ILLEGALLY DOWNLOAD THIS MOVIE." on the blackboard.

We fade into a crowd scene at Springfield Lake at night. Green Day are playing as part of the "Duff Summer Concert Series". Mrs. Krabappel is on Principal Skinner's shoulders; she opens her sweater to reveal a T-Shirt with a downward arrow and the words "Not My Boyfriend". Comic Book Guy is trying to crowd surf, much to the crowd's displeasure.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Excuse me, my hinie is dipping!

They crowd drops him. Billie Joe Armstrong from Green Day sings "da-da-da" to the final part of the Simpsons tune, following his teleprompter.

BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG
Alright, well thanks a lot for coming. We've been playing for three and a half hours, now we'd like just a minute of your time to say something about the environment.

There is a deathly silence, followed by huge boos from the Springfieldians. They start throwing things at Green Day.

BARNEY
Preachy!

BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG
We're not being preachy!

FRANK EDWIN WRIGHT III
But the pollution in your lake - it's dissolving our barge!

Moe is sat in a deck chair. Lisa is stood next to him.

LISA
I thought they touched on a vital issue.

MOE
I beg to differ.

He throws a rock at the stage, which penetrates the bass drum and hits Frank in the crotch.

FRANK EDWIN WRIGHT III
Oh!

MICHAEL PRITCHARD
Gentlemen, it's been an honour playing with you tonight.

Green Day put down their instruments and bring out violins as the barge sinks. Lisa looks on woefully.

EXT. First Church of Springfield, daytime. A billboard outside reads "THOU SHALT TURN OFF THY CELL PHONE". Inside, Mrs. Glick plays "American Idiot: Funeral Version" on the organ.

LOVEJOY
For the latest rock band to die in our town. Lord, hear our prayer.

CONGREGATION
Lord, hear our prayer.

Car tyres screech to a halt outside. We see the Simpsons' silhouettes as the family make their way to the church door. Their conversation can also be heard.

MARGE
I hate being late!

HOMER
Well I hate going. Why can't I worship the Lord in my own way, by praying like hell on my death bed.

MARGE
Homer, they can hear you inside!

HOMER
Relax! Those pious morons are too busy talking to their phoney-baloney God!

The family enter the church to total silence and angry looks. They make their way to their pew.

HOMER
How ya doin'? Peace be with you. Praise Jebus.

The family sit down next to Grampa who is already there, sleeping. Bart brings out a Gameboy-like device and plays a game called 'Baby Blast'. Maggie notices and angrily pulls the game cartridge from the Gameboy.

LOVEJOY
Now today I'd like to try something a little different. I'm gonna call on one of you!

He points at the congregation, who gasp in shock, then cower.

LOVEJOY
Now the word of God dwells within everyone, I want you to let that word out! Let your spirit--

NED
(raising arm) Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

LOVEJOY
(sighs) What is it, Ned?

NED
The good Lord is telling me to confess to something.

HOMER
(quietly, with fingers crossed) Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay...

NED
An immodest sense of pride in our community.

LOVEJOY
Somebody else. Let the Lord's light shine upon you!

Cut to Grampa, still asleep. Light shines through the window behind him. Grampa leans forward but the beam of light follows him. His eyes open and he slowly stands.

LOVEJOY
Feel the spirit. Let it out!

Grampa suddenly springs to life, possessed.

GRAMPA
Horrible! Horrible things are going to happen! (he starts pointing) And they're going to happen to you, and you, and you... (points at Marge) and you! Oh nelly!

He falls to the floor, writhing. Comic Book Guy calmly starts recording him with a camera phone.

GRAMPA
People of Springfield! Heed this warning. Twisted tail! A thousand eyes! Trapped forever!!

He 'walks' in a circle on the floor, making noises.

LISA
Dad, do something!

Homer picks up a Bible and quickly flicks through it.

HOMER
This book doesn't have any answers!

GRAMPA
Beware! Beware! Time is short. Eeepa! Eeepa! Eeeeeeepaaaaa! (falls to floor again) Believe me! Believe me!

Homer rolls his father up in the aisle rug and drags him out of the church, still moaning.

GRAMPA
Thanks for listening!

EXT. The drive home. In the car, Marge gives Grampa (still wrapped in the rug) a puzzled look.

HOMER
Okay! Who want waffles?

BART, LISA, GRAMPA
I do I do I do!

MARGE
Wait a minute, what about Grampa?

BART
I want syrup!

LISA
I want strawberry!

MARGE
Something happened to that man.

HOMER
I'll tell ya what happened: A certain someone had a senior moment. But that's okay, because we love him, and we got a free rug out of it. (kisses Grampa on the forehead)

MARGE
What is the point of going to church every Sunday, when if someone we love has a genuine religious experience, we ignore it? Right Grampa?

There is a short silence.

GRAMPA
I want bananas on my waffles!

HOMER
I rest my case.

The family pull up at the waffle place.

MARGE
I'm not dropping this.

She gets out the car and heads inside. The rest of the family follow, leaving Grampa behind.

GRAMPA
Wait a minute! I'm still in the car!

HOMER
(returning) Oh. Right.

He opens the car door, winds the window down a bit, then leaves his father.

EXT. The Simpsons home. Homer starts his chores. #1, 'Go to church' is crossed off.

HOMER
(reading) Take out hornet's nest.

The nest is hanging from a tree. Homer pokes it with a broom handle; it falls and he catches it. He places it in Flanders' mail box, and gives it a shake.

HOMER
Check. (reads) Fix sink hole.

There is a hole in the middle of the lawn, which appears to be submerging. Homer pulls the sandbox over it, but the sand starts to sink, too. He places Maggie in the hole; she plugs it nicely.

HOMER
Check. (reads) Reshingle roof?

Homer and Bart are on the roof. Homer is about to hammer a nail in. His thumb covers the nail head.

HOMER
Steady... steady...

Homer suddenly stabs himself in the eye with the back of the hammer.

HOMER
Owww! Owww!

Bart laughs hysterically. Homer pulls the hammer out of his eye.

HOMER
Why you little...! (strangles Bart) I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!

Bart struggles free.

BART
You know, we are on the roof. We could have some fun.

HOMER
What kind of fun?

BART
How about a dare contest?

HOMER
That sounds fun. I dare you to... climb the T.V. antennae.

Bart does so.

BART
Piece of cake.

Homer starts shaking the antennae.

HOMER
Earthquake! Earthquake!

They both laugh. Bart is thrown off the antennae and bounces down the roof, grabbing the gutter as he falls. Homer starts shaking the gutter.

HOMER
Aftershock! Aftershock!

NED
(from his garden) Uh, Homer, I don't mean to be a nervis-pervis or anything, but if he falls, couldn't that make your boy a parapleg-a-rino?

HOMER
(hammering the gutter) Shut up, Flanders!

BART
Yeah, shut up, Flanders!

HOMER
Well said, boy. (They high-five, then Homer readies another nail for the gutter) Steady... steady... steady...

The roof suddenly breaks and Homer falls through, and Bart laughs. Inside we can see Grampa reading 'Oatmeal Enthusiast'.

EXT. Springfield street. Lisa is in the distance, going door-to-door.

LISA
(door is answered) Hello. Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, but I'm sure you're as worried about the pollution is Lake Springfield as I am--

The door is slammed in her face. She moves on to the next house.

LISA
Lake Springfield has higher levels of mercury than ev--

The door is slammed in her face again. She moves on to the next house, where an old lady answers.

OLD LADY
Why it's the little girl who saved my cat.

LISA
Lake Springfield--

Again, the door is shut on Lisa. She sighs. As she looks around the street, everyone in their houses closes curtains and slams doors. Captain McCallister shuts the door to his house-boat and drives it away down a conveniently-placed river. Lisa groans again. As she walks past another house, the door opens to Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Come on over, Lisa. You can canvas me as long as you want.

LISA
Milhouse, you don't care about the environment.

MILHOUSE
Hey! I am very passionate about the planet!

Nelson Muntz appears behind Milhouse with his fist raised.

NELSON
Say global warming is a myth!

MILHOUSE
It's a myth! Further study is needed!

Nelson punches Milhouse in the chest.

NELSON
That's for selling out your beliefs.

Lisa goes to Milhouse to console him.

LISA
Oh, poor Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
(awakens in a daze) Dream coming true...

Lise hears an Irish voice. A young boy is canvassing door-to-door, just like Lisa was.

COLIN
Are you aware that a leaky faucet can waste over--

The door is slammed in his face. Lisa finishes his sentence.

LISA
Two thousand gallons a year!

COLIN
And turning off your lights could save--

LISA
--enough energy to power Pittburgh!

COLIN
And if we just kept our thermostats at sixty-eight in the winter--

LISA
--we'd be free from our dependency on foreign oil in seventeen years!

COLIN
I'm Colin.

LISA
I haven't seen you at school.

COLIN
Just moved here from Ireland. My Dad's a musician.

LISA
Is he--

COLIN
He's not Bono.

LISA
I just thought because you're Irish, and you care about--

COLIN
(angrily) He's not Bono!

LISA
Do you play?

COLIN
Just piano, guitar, trumpet, drums and bass.

LISA
(thinking) He's pure gold! For once in your life, be cool!

COLIN
So, is your name as pretty as your face?

Lisa lets out a loud laugh and faints.

COLIN
You okay there?

Lisa laughs and giggles.

INT. Simpsons kitchen. Marge watches Grampa's ramblings on Comic Book Guy's camera-phone.

GRAMPA
(in video) A twisted tail! A thousand eyes! Trapped forever! Eepa! Eepa!

MARGE
Eepa? What could that be?

COMIC BOOK GUY
I believe it's the sound the green lantern made when Sinestro threw him into a vat of acid. Eeepaa!

MARGE
(unconvined) Yeah... Thanks for coming over.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Thanks for giving me your pregnancy pants. Never known comfort like this.

EXT. Simpsons front lawn. Homer is carrying bricks on his back while Bart shoots at him with a pellet gun.

HOMER
(hit with pellets) D'oh! D'oh! Why did I (hit with more pellets) suggest this? (hit with more pellets)

Meanwhile, an advertising banner scrolls along the bottom of the screen. It reads: WATCH "ARE YOU SMARTER THAN A CELEBRITY?" - WEDNESDAYS ON FOX. THAT'S RIGHT, WE EVEN ADVERTISE SHOWS DURING MOVIES NOW.

A timer dings. Homer drops the bricks off his back.

HOMER
Alright boy, time for the ultimate dare. I dare YOU to skateboard to Krusty Burger - and back - naked!

BART
How naked?

HOMER
Fourth base.

BART
But girls might see my doodle.

HOMER
(taunting) Oh, I see. Then I hereby declare you 'chicken for life'. Every morning you'll wake up to "Good morning chicken!" At your wedding, I'll sing (he sings the wedding anthem in clucking noises; as Bart skateboard past him naked, he makes a surprised clucking sound).

We follow Bart's skateboarding journey through Springfield. He shocks the townspeople as he rides past them. He rides past Ralph Wiggum.

RALPH
I like men now!

Bart skateboards through the town square.

AGNES SKINNER
Don't look where I'm pointing!

She points at Bart, her hand following his movement and conveniently covering his shame. Bart rides past Jimbo offering Dolph a cigarette; Otto throwing a frisbee; a remote control car; a flying dove; a sprinkler; a girl blowing bubbles; and some dandelions - all of which obscure his private parts. Then Bart passes a hedge with the bottom cut out and we, ahem, get to see his doodle...

After this he passes a police car which promptly follows him, siren blaring. Wiggum, Lou and Eddie are in the car.

WIGGUM
Stop in the name of American squeamishness!

Lou fires a gun from the car, taking out the skateboard's back wheel. Bart loses control, hits a kerb and goes flying past Hans Moleman in his truck (who screams). In Krusty Burger, Ned and his kids are about to eat.

NED
Boys, before we eat, don't forget to thank the Lord for this bountiful-- (Bart hits the window, sticking to it.) --penis?!

ROD & TODD
Bountiful penis.

TODD
Amen.

EXT. Krusty Burger, some time later. Lou and Eddie prise Bart off the window.

LOU
Uh, listen kid, nobody likes wearing clothes in public, but you know, it's... it's the law.

Bart pops off the window and Lou handcuffs him to a lamp post.

WIGGUM
Lunch time!

The cops head inside.

BART
You can't leave me out here!

LOU
Don't worry, we found a friend for you to play with.

He brings Nelson over.

NELSON
Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! (fade to much later; Nelson is still going but is tired) Ha ha... Ha ha... Ha ha...

Nelson's mother appears.

MRS. MUNTZ
Nelson, honey, where have you been? (Nelson points at Bart) Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha!

Homer pulls up in the car.

BART
Dad!

HOMER
What seems to be the problem, officers?

BART
Tell them you dared me to do it!

WIGGUM
If that's true, then you should be taking the rap here, not your son.

HOMER
(getting out the car) And what happens to me if it's my fault?

WIGGUM
You'll have to attend a one hour parenting class.

HOMER
It was all his idea! He's out of control I tell ya! Oh, I'm at my wit's end! (sobs)

Bart is unhandcuffed and the cops leave.

WIGGUM
See you in court, kid.

Homer stops sobbing.

HOMER
Okay son, let's get some lunch.

BART
Did you at least bring my clothes?

HOMER
Shirt, socks, everything you need.

BART
You didn't bring my pants!

HOMER
Who am I, Tommy Bahama?

BART
Oh, this is the worst day of my life.

HOMER
The worst day of your life so far.

They go into Krusty Burger. Bart walks past Ned.

NED
Say, Bart.

BART
What do you want, Flanders?

NED
If you need pants, I carry and extra pair. I mean, you know how boys are, always praying through the knees.

BART
Why are you helping me? I'm not your kid.

NED
We're neighbours. I'm sure your father would do the same for my boys.

Homer steals the Flanders' kids' fries and takes Bart.

HOMER
Thank you.

Homer and Bart are at a table. We see an interior shot of Homer's mouth as he eats. Bart is angry.

HOMER
Hey, what's with you?

BART
(melancholy) You really wanna know?

HOMER
Of course I do. What kind of father wouldn't care about (sees something) a pig wearing a hat!

Krusty the Clown is filming a commercial.

DIRECTOR
Action!

KRUSTY
Hey hey! It's your old pal Krusty for my new pork sandwich, the clogger! If you can find a greasier sandwich, you're in Mexico! (he laughs then takes a bite of the sandwich) Mmm!

DIRECTOR
And... we're clear.

Krusty spits out the sandwich.

KRUSTY
Perfect. Cut, print, kill the pig.

A saw is held up to the pig. It squeals in terror.

HOMER
(gasps) What? You can't kill him if he's wearing people clothes!

The pig runs across to Homer, giving him a forlorn look. To the tune of 'Happy Together', Homer briefly imagines himself and the pig dancing in a field. He picks up the pig.

HOMER
You're coming home with me.

INT. Simpson kitchen. Maggie is playing the Baby Blast game she took from Bart earlier. Marge rearranges magnetic words on the fridge, from Grampa's outburst in church.

MARGE
A thousand eyes. What could that be?

GRAMPA
Hmm... I'm pretty sure a thousand... is a number.

Homer pokes his head round the door.

HOMER
Hey Marge! Isn't it great being married to someone who's recklessly impulsive?

MARGE
Actually, it's aged me horribly.

HOMER
Then say hello to the newest Simpson!

He brings the pig in. Marge looks at it's curly tail and gasps. The camera zooms in on the "twisted tail" magnets on the fridge.

MARGE
Homer! (Homer and the pig are sharing an orange potato chip) I believe what happened in church was a warning about precisely this! Please get rid of that pig!

HOMER
Oh, you're gonna love him! Look, he does and impression of you. (Homer pulls its tail and it squeals; Homer laughs) You nailed her. (Marge still looks worried) He also does me... (Homer squeezes him and he burps; Marge giggles) You smiled, I'm off the hook!

INT. Bart's bedroom, evening. Homer brushes the pig's hair into several different styles.

HOMER
Oh, you have so many looks.

He picks the pig up and walks out. Bart is in the tree outside the room. As he watches Homer leave, he sighs. A light is switched on in the Flanders' house. Ned tucks Rod and Todd into bed, kissing them on the forehead and vacuuming their sheets.

BART
(to himself) So that's what snug is.

HOMER
(in the bedroom again) Who's a good pig? (belly-kisses the pig) Who's a good pig? (belly-kisses the pig)

Bart prepares to use his slingshot on Homer.

NED
(from window) Rough day, huh son?

BART
You don't know what rough is, sister.

NED
(chuckles) Bart, you know, whenever my boys bake up a batch of "frownies", I take them fishing. Does your Dad every take you fishing?

Bart has a flashback of himself fishing with Homer. Homer plugs a bug-zapper into a battery.

BART
Dad, it's not fair to use a bug-zapper to catch the fish.

HOMER
If you love fish like I do, you want them to die with dignity.

He drops the bug-zapper in the water. It electrifies the whole lake and hundreds of fish float to the top.

HOMER
I think I have a nibble!

He reaches for a fish and is electrocuted. He manages to pull one out and is electrocuted again upon biting it. Back to the present.

BART
I think fishing might be more fun with you.

NED
Oh great! Now, how about I fix you some cocoa.

BART
No way, cocoa's for wusses.

NED
Well sir, if you change your mind, it's on the window sill.

Flanders sprays whipped cream on the top of a mug and places it on the sill. He adds a flake. Then grates some chocolate over it. Then sprays more whipped cream on the flake. Then sticks a marshmallow on the cream. Then takes a blow torch to the delicacy, browning the marshmallow. He leaves. Bart cautiously approaches, takes the cup and retreats to the other side of the garden. He takes a sip.

BART
Oh my God.

INT. Simpsons' hallway. Marge scrubs the pig tracks on the floor. Lisa is sitting on the stairs.

LISA
Oh wait, I didn't tell you the best part: he loves the environment. Ooh wait, I still didn't tell you the best part: he's got an Irish brogue! No no, wait wait, I still didn't tell you the best part: he's not imaginary!

MARGE
Aw honey, that's great! But the very best thing is that he listens to you. Because nothing means more than for a man to-- (looks up) how did the pig tracks get on the ceiling?

Homer is holding the pig upside down and running him back and forth along the ceiling. He sings to the tune of the Spider-Man theme.

HOMER
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig,
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does,
Can he swing, from a web?
No he can't, he's a pig,
Look out! He is a Spider-Pig.

Marge looks on, blankly.

EXT. Springfield Lake. Bart and Ned are fishing.

BART
Are we having fun yet?

NED
We are now: you've got a bite!

BART
(trying to reel it in) Whoa, mama!

The fishing rod is pulled away from him; it falls into the lake.

NED
Oh no, my good pole!

Bart acts as if he's being strangled, then realizes he's not.

BART
Huh? You're not strangling me.

NED
What the-- Strangling's only good for... well, it's not good for anything. I think the only time you should lay hand on a boy is if you're giving him a good old pat on the back. (He reaches for Bart)

BART
Hey, what the Hell are ya-- (Ned pats him on the back) Ah. One more time.

As they have an emotional moment, we see pollution building up in the river. The camera pans across Krusty emptying a tanker of "Flop Sweat" into the lake, Crazy Cat Lady scrubbing cats on a washboard, and Moe dumping a truck full of bottles (and Barney).

BARNEY
Honey, I'm home!

He sinks. Lisa looks on, disgusted. She breaks her clipboard in anger.

EXT. Springfield Town Hall. A banner reads: "Lisa Simpson Presents: An Irritating Truth". Inside, Lisa, Colin and Mayor Quimby are on stage. A line-graph labelled "Pollution in Lake Springfield" is displayed on a projector screen. Colin is playing soothing music.

LISA
We're at the tipping point, people. If we don't do something now... (distracted by Colin) I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. Isn't he dreamy?

QUIMBY
Agreed. (bangs hammer)

LISA
Okay, so here's the bottom line. If we don't change our ways right now, pollution in Lake Springfield will be at this level.

Lisa, on a scissor lift, tries to guesture to the top of the graph, but the platform only raises a short way.

LENNY
That's not so bad.

LISA
No, the lift is stuck!

She pulls a lever to try and raise it; it jumps up and down several times before crashing though the ceiling. She pokes her head down.

LISA
Am I getting through to anyone?

KRUSTY
Hell yeah! We need a new one of those things! (points to lift)

QUIMBY
All in favour of a new scissor lift, say "aye".

EVERYONE
Aye!

LISA
No! (brings the lift back down) This lake is just one piece of trash away from a toxic nightmare! But I knew you wouldn't listen. So I took the liberty of pouring water from the lake in all your drinking glasses.

Everyone has just taken a sip; they all spit out their green water simultaneously.

MOE
This is why we should hate kids.

QUIMBY
This is serious, people, No more dumping in the lake. I hereby declare a state of emergency. Code black!

Everyone gasps.

LENNY
Black? That's the worst color there is! No offense there, Carl.

CARL
I get it all the time.

A newspaper spins into view; it reads "Springfield Cleans Up Act", with the subheading "Pushy Kid Nags Town". We merge to a net fishing the paper out of the lake. Lenny and Carl plug a pipe from Springfield Nuclear Power Plant with a big cork. As they leave the lake, their overalls disintegrate. Many Springfieldians pick up litter from the lakeshore, while cranes drop concrete barriers along the edge. The mafia bring a body (wrapped up but with the feet sticking out) to dump; Chief Wiggum discourages them.

WIGGUM
Sorry, no dumping in the lake.

FAT TONY
Fine. I will put my "yard trimmings" in a car compacter. (They leave.)

LOU
Uh, Chief, I think there was a dead body in there.

WIGGUM
I thought that too, until he said "yard trimmings". Gotta learn to listen, Lou.

Quimby and some officials are by the new barrier.

QUIMBY
Let us now make sure this barrier is completely idiot-proof. (calls) Cletus!

CLETUS
Yes'm.

QUIMBY
Try to dump something in the lake.

CLETUS
Okay. (He produces a dead rat and heads towards the lake. He continually bumps into the barrier.) I can't. I simply can't.

The officials mutter acceptances.

OFFICIAL 1
Brilliant.

OFFICIAL 2
Very effective.

Simpson home. Homer and Spider-Pig are watching Bumblebee Man on television. He pays one peso for a kiss at a booth, but is kissed by a donkey.

BUMBLEBEE MAN
Ay ay ay! Un burro amoroso!

HOMER
(to Spider-Pig) Don't get any ideas. (nudging him) Heh?

They both laugh; Homer slides off the sofa onto the floor.

HOMER
Maybe we should kiss, just to break the tension.

MARGE
(entering) What's going on here?

HOMER
Nothing, nothing!

MARGE
I'm not sure that pig should be in the house. And by the way, what are you doing with his...leavings?

HOMER
Don't worry, I've devised a most elegant solution.

Outside, they look on at a large silo with a smiling pig face and "Pig Crap" handwritten on the side. It drips.

MARGE
Ugh, it's leaking!

HOMER
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.

MARGE
He filled up the whole silo in just two days?

HOMER
Well, I helped. (He heads back towards the house.)

MARGE
Homer, stop! I know it's easy for your mind to wander...

Inside Homer's head we see a monkey clapping cymbals.

MARGE
...but I want you to really conventrate on me.

The monkey puts the cymbals down and points to Marge.

MARGE
I can't escape the feeling this is the crisis Grampa warned us about. You have to dispose of that waste properly.

HOMER
(solemnly) Okay Marge, I will.

MARGE
You can take Spider-Pig with you!

HOMER
He's not Spider-Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper.

Homer pulls up outside the Hazardous Waste Treatment Center with the silo tied to the car roof. There is a long queue of cars in front. A phone rings the "Nokia theme"; Homer searches for it, then realizes the pig has swallowed it; he squeezes Plopper, who spits out the phone.

HOMER
(answering) Yello.

LENNY
(outside Lardlad Donuts) Homer, you gotta get over here. The health inspector just shut down the donut store and they're giving out free donuts!

HOMER
Oh my god oh my god oh my god! I just got one thing I gotta do first.

LENNY
Well you'd better hurry, they're goin' fast!

Wiggum passes by, biting on several donuts that are hooked over his gun. The gun goes off, shooting his hat.

WIGGUM
Whoa, that was close!

He returns to eating donuts off the gun. Back at the Treatment Center, Homer is anxious; he drives off and ends up at Springfield Lake. The lake is fronted by hundreds of "No Dumping" signs; Homer drives straight through them all, including running down Hans Moleman with a "You Suck" sign. He cuts the ropes on his car, dumping the silo into the lake. As it sinks, green bubbles start to appear and soon the whole lake is green and bubbling.

HOMER
Uh-oh.

In front of Homer, a skull-and-crossbones image forms in the water.

EERIE VOICE
Evil!

Homer runs to the car and jumps in the back seat. Plopper is in front of him.

HOMER
Drive, drive drive! (Plopper oinks) Oh, right.

He gets in the front and drives off. At the lakeshore, a racoon chases a squirrel into the toxic water. The squirrel emerges as a multi-eyed mutant with sharp teeth and chases the racoon away.

Bart and Ned are hiking near the lake. They reach the top of a hill.

FLANDERS
Look at that. You can see the four states that border Springfield: Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky.

BART
Oh yeah!

FLANDERS
If you look real close, you can almost-- yaah!

He spots the mutant squirrel, which is perched nonchalantly on a rock.

FLANDERS
This certainly seems odd... but who am I to question the work of the almighty? Oh, we thank you Lord for this might fine intelligent design. Good job!

We now see through the multiple eyes of the mutant as Bart approaches it, then pokes its eyes with a stick.

BART
Jab! Jab! Jab-jab-jab!

A voice calls from off-screen.

MALE EPA OFFICIAL
Hey! Jab one more eye, and it's a federal crime.

A female officer places the mutant in a container.

FLANDERS
Who are you?

FEMALE EPA OFFICER
Environmental Protection Agency

The officers get into a van and drive off.

EXT. The White House. Inside, a man salutes an official and approaches reception, carrying the mutant.

CARGILL
Russ Cargill, head of the EPA. Here to see the President.

An security device scans his eyes, and then the many eyes of the mutant. He enters the Oval Office.

CARGILL
Mr. President.

The President is a McBain-esque Arnold Schwarzenegger.

SCHWARZENEGGER
Ya, that is me.

CARGILL
Pollution in Springfield has reached crisis levels.

SCHWARZENEGGER
Ugh, I hate this job. Everything's "crisi" this and "end of the world" that. Nobody opens with a joke. I miss Danny Devito.

CARGILL
You want a joke, huh? Stop me if you've heard this one. (lifts up the container with the mutant).

SCHWARZENEGGER
Aah! (looks closer) Look at those angry eyes, and giant teeth. It's like Christmas at the Kennedy compound.

CARGILL
You know sir, when you made me head of the EPA, you were applauded for appointing one of the most successful men in America to the least successful agency in government. And why did I take the job; 'cause I'm a rich man and wanted to give something back. Not the money, but something. So here is our chance to kick some ass for Mother Earth.

SCHWARZENEGGER
I'm listening.

CARGILL
Well, I've narrowed your choices down, the five unthinkable options. Each will cause untold misery--

SCHWARZENEGGER
I pick number three!

CARGILL
You don't even wanna read them first?

SCHWARZENEGGER
I was elected to lead, not to read. Number three!

EXT. Springfield. A shadow looms over the horizon. It passes over a bunch of people in a park, including Lenny, Carl, Gil and Arthur Crandall, Gabbo's puppeteer. Crandall's mouth gapes in horror; Gabbo's mouth falls off.

Milhouse uses his inhaler. As the shadow passes over, he swallows the it out of shock.

The shadow passes over Moe's Bar and Springfield Church (conveniently located next door to each other). Reverend Lovejoy and various church-goers rush outside, as do the barflies. Each group screams and runs into the opposite building - church-goers into Moe's and the barflies into the church.

We discover the shadow is an incredibly massive glass dome being carried over Springfield by helicopters, using suction cups on the end of rope. As it is lowered, it crushes the L in the giant SPRINGFIELD sign. At Springfield Elementary, the kids play outside. Martin Prince sits on a seesaw.

MARTIN
We're being sealed in a dome!

The edge of the dome lands on the opposite end of the seesaw and flies off to the other side of the playground, hitting the inside of the dome. A man stands on the road in panic.

MAN
What do I do, I don't know what to do! 'Cause if I stay I'm trapped, if I leave I'm alone! Oh god, in, out, in, out... I never saw Venice! I--

The man is crushed by the dome's edge. Cut to The Simpsons coming out of their house, mouths agape. The edge of the dome is right at the end of their garden; it crushed their fence. The helicopter release their grip on the dome. Marge spots "EPA" on the side of the helicopters.

MARGE
Epa! Epa! Trapped forever. It's all come true.

GRAMPA
That crazy old man in church was right!

Homer lets out a huge annoyed grunt...

HOMER
Dooooooooooooooome!

Springfieldians gather at the dome's edge. A van labelled "S.P.D. Hometown Security" approaches, and officers from Springfield Police Department emerge, with guns and protective gear.

WIGGUM
Alright men, open fire!

The officers shoot at the side of the dome but the bullets rebound and hit them.

WIGGUM
Who's hurt? Raise your hands. (they all groan) Without the attitude.

PROFESSOR FRINK
People, people! I have an important announcement. I have just perfected an acid-firing super-drill which can cut throough anything. (the crowd mutter excitedly) It's right there, just... outside of the dome...

Everyone groans. Sideshow Mel whacks the glass with his hair-bone.

SIDESHOW MEL
What ruthless mad men could have done this to us?

CARGILL
(off-screen) The United States Government! (he appears on a screen high up on the dome) My name's Russ Cargill, and I'm head of the EPA.

Everyone looks puzzled.

MOE
The what?

CARGILL
The Environmental Protection Agency.

LENNY
Come again?

CARGILL
Look, I' a man on a big TV, just listen. Springfield has become--

MAN
Whoo! Springfield!

CARGILL
--the most polluted city in the history of the planet.

KRUSTY
Drama Queen!

CARGILL

To prevent your poisons from spreading the goverment has sealed you all within this dome. Believe me, it's the last thing we wanted to do, I do own the company that makes the dome, but that's beside the point.

MOE
What are you telling us, that we're trapped like rats?!

CARGILL
No, rats can't be trapped this easily. You're trapped like... carrots!

LISA
Wait, wait! We couldn't be more polluted; everybody stopped dumping in the lake!

CARGILL
Apparently someone didn't get the message.

HOMER
(stepping away from Plopper) Act natural.

CARL
Hey, buddy, sooner or later, people are gonna come by and discover this!

CARGILL
Don't worry about that. We found a way to take you off the map.

A man drives past Springfield. His GPS system shows Springfield ahead.

GPS
Coming up on your right... (Springfield vanishes from the map) ...nothing.


#### SET 3 ####
ACT ONE
Bart and Lisa are fishing. A car pulls up and a man gets out.

SHUTTON
Ah, so kids, caught anything?

LISA
Not yet, sir.

SHUTTON
Uh-huh. What are you using for bait?

LISA
My brother's using worms, but I, who feel the tranquility far outweighs the actual catching of fish, am using nothing.

SHUTTON
I see. And, uh, what's your name, son?

BART
I'm Bart Simpson, who the hell are you?

SHUTTON
(chuckles) I'm Dave Shutton. I'm an investigative reporter who's on the road a lot and, uh, I must say that in my day, we didn't talk that way to our elders.

BART
Well, this is my day, and we do, sir. (he catches something on the line.) All right! We eat tonight!

He reels the fish in, but there is something peculiar about it - it has three eyes.

SHUTTON
Wait a minute... one... two... three?

He looks into the distance and sees the power plant pumping out waste into the lake. We see several newspaper headlines: "Mutation Caught At Ol' Fishin' Hole / Is Power Plant Responsible?" and "Fishin' Hole Or Fission Hole? / Burns Denies Responsibility In Fish Flap." Marge reads the newspaper at breakfast.

MARGE
Well, leave it to good old Mary Bailey to finally step in and do something about that hideous genetic mutation.

HOMER
Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.

MARGE
Like what?

HOMER
Like getting Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's Birthday back as separate paid holidays. "President's Day," pfft, what a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out--

MARGE
You're late for work, Homer.

HOMER
So? Someone'll punch in for me.

LISA
Try not to spill anything, Dad.

BART
Keep those mutants comin', Homer!

HOMER
I'll mutant you...

Homer arrives at work and proceeds to the lunch room.

HOMER
Oh man, plain cake donuts. (calling) Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys! (quietly to himself) Why can't I ever get here on time?

An announcement comes over the PA.

BURNS
Hi-ho, faceless employees. In a few moments the government inspection team will be touring the plant. (cut to outside) So look busy and keep your mouth shut. That is all.

SMITHERS
Very stirring, sir. (looks into binoculars) Uh oh, here they come, sir.

BURNS
Hold me, Smithers.

INSPECTOR
Okay, men. Geiger counters on.

The Geiger counters go crazy.

BURNS
Ah, I suppose that's normal background radiation? The kind you'd find at any well-maintained nuclear facility, or for that matter, playgrounds and hospitals.

INSPECTOR
Sorry.

They begin the inspection. The inspector notes down details.

INSPECTOR
Gum used to seal crack in cooling tower.

BURNS
D'oh. I'm as shocked as you are.

INSPECTOR
Plutonium rod used as paperweight.

BURNS
D'oh. Now that shouldn't be.

A drop of glowing green goo burns a hole through the inspector's clipboard.

BURNS
Yeah, well, that's always been like that.

They visit Homer's workstation. Homer is sleeping, and wakes with a start.

HOMER
Aah! (starts pulling levers wildly) Uh, just resting my eyes!

BURNS
Ah, well done. A rested employee is a vigilant employee.

INSPECTOR
(sighs) Monitoring station unmanned.

The inspectors stand in knee-deep glowing green water.

BURNS
Look here, inspector, could I speak to you privately, in my office?

The chief inspector is taken to Burns' office.

INSPECTOR
Mr. Burns, in twenty years, I have never seen such a shoddy, deplorable--

BURNS
Oh, look! Some careless person has left thousands and thousands of dollars just lying here on my coffee table. Uh, Smithers, why don't we leave the room, and hopefully, when we
return, the pile of money will be gone. (leaves then returns a few moments later) D'oh, look Smithers, the money and a very stupid man are still here.

INSPECTOR
Burns, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to bribe me.

BURNS
Is there some confusion about this? (stuff money into his pockets) Take it! Take it! Take it, you poor schmo!

INSPECTOR
Mr. Burns! I'm gonna overlook this felony, however, I will not overlook the three hundred and forty two violations I observed at your plant today. Either bring this place up to code or we'll shut it down. Good day. (leaves)

BURNS
Oh well, a little dab of paint here, a little spackle there... how much could it possibly cost to fix this place up?

SMITHERS
(typing on a calculator) Approximately fifty-six million dollars, sir.

BURNS
Fifty-six million!?

SMITHERS
(cowering) Don't hit me, sir.

BURNS
Oh, that I have the strength to take it out on you, Smithers. Now, please go, I... want to be alone.

Burns hits the bottle. Time passes from 5:00 to 9:30, and Burns is drunk. He starts singing "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime".

BURNS
Once I built a railroad, made it run,
Made it race against time,
Once I built a railroad, now it's done,
Brother, can you spare a dime?

He stumbles down the long empty corridors, singing.

Half a million boots went sloggin' through hell
And I was the kid with the drum!
(his bottle is empty) Empty. Bah!

He throws the bottle away, and it wakes Homer, who is still asleep at his workstation.

Aah! Just resting my eyes! (realizes no one's there) Oh, heh. (looks at his watch) Holy moly! Nine thirty! (picks up phone and dials) Hello Marge. Sorry I didn't call but it's been a madhouse down here. Yep, these twelve hour days are killing me. (He walks down a long empty corridor.) Echo! (it echoes)

Outside in the car park, Burns is still singing, and getting into his car.

BURNS
They called me Al!
It was Al all the time,
Say, don't you remember?
I'm your pal.
Buddy, can you spare a dime?

Homer walks up the window.

HOMER
Huh? What the-- (taps on window) Uh, Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Aah!

HOMER
Aah! Sorry, sir, it's just me, Homer Simpson. Everything alright?

BURNS
Working late, Simpson?

HOMER
Uh, yes sir.

BURNS
You and I are a dying breed, Simpson. I'm going to share something with you. (opens door) Hop in.

HOMER
Ooh, cushy!

BURNS
Homer, they're trying to shut us down. They say we're poisoning the planet!

HOMER
Well, nobody's perfect.

BURNS
Can't the government just get off our backs?

HOMER
Y'know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently--

BURNS
Oh, get off your soap box, Simpson, do you realize how much t costs to run for office? more than any honest man could afford.

HOMER
I bet you could afford it, though. (nervously) Don't get me wrong, I mean you're an honest man, I just mean that you could afford to run for governor if you felt like it. Of course I'm just rambling cause... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true! I mean, if you were governor you could decide what's safe and what isn't...

Burns starts the car and drives off.

HOMER
Where are we going, sir?

BURNS
To create a new and better world.

HOMER
If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?



ACT TWO
Homer reads the newspaper, with the headline "Burns Enters Gubernatorial Race".

HOMER
Well, he's got my vote!

MARGE
Homer, we're a Mary Bailey family.

HOMER
Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns!

LISA
Ooh, a political discussion at our table. I feel like a Kennedy!

MARGE
Well, frankly, I don't see how one of the most despicable men who ever lived has a chance against Mary Bailey, the most beloved governor our great state has ever known.

Mr. Burns calls a meeting.

ADVISER
Now, here's the problem as I see it. While Governor Bailey is beloved by all, ninety-eight percent of the voters rate you as despicable or worse. That's why we've assembled the finest campaign team money can buy. (indicating his team) This is your speech writer, your joke writer, your spin doctor, make-up man and personal trainer. Their job, to turn this Mr. Burns... (shows a normal portrait of Burns) into this... (shows a picture of Burns in a heroic position).

BURNS
Why are my teeth showing like that?

ADVISOR
Because you're smiling!

BURNS
Ah, excellent! This is exactly the kind of trickery I'm paying you for. B-but how do we turn your average Joe Six-pack against Mary Bailey?

ADVISOR
With this team of investigators... (indicating) your much-raker, your character assassin, your mud slinger, your garbologist.

BURNS
Hello.

ADVISOR
Their job is to turn Mary Bailey from this... (picture of Bailey) into this (picture of crowd booing her)

BURNS
Ah, visual aids help so much. Thank you.

ADVISOR
But first, there's a burning issue that we need to address and neutralize immediately.

He shows Burns a picture of the three-eyed fish.

BURNS
Ugh, I hate that fish!

Grampa Simpson and the pensioners watch TV.

TV ANNOUNCER
Thank you for watching "Movie For A Dreary Afternoon". Please stay tuned for a paid political announcement brought to you by the friends of Montgomery Burns

GRAMPA
Burns? Change the channel!

JASPER
You change it.

GRAMPA
No, you change it!

JASPER
I changed it last week!

GRAMPA
Fine, be a jerk. Then we'll just sit here and watch it.

At Moe's Tavern.

BARNEY
Oh no, an election? That's one of those deals where they close the bars, isn't it?

MOE
Sorry, Barney.

At the Simpsons home.

MARGE
I wonder if he's going to say anything about that horrible fish.

HOMER
Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this all out of proportion you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.

Marge groans. The advisors prepare Burns for his campaign advertisement.

SMITHERS
Thirty seconds to air, Mr. Burns.

ADVISOR
Now remember to smile.

BURNS
I am smiling.

ADVISOR
You'll have to do better than that.

BURNS
(grunts) How's this?

ADVISOR
There you go!

BURNS
Oh, I'm going to be sore tomorrow!

ADVISOR
Well, we've done all we can. the rest is up to you.

BURNS
Oh, don't worry. By the time this paid political announcement is done, every Johnny Lunchpail in this whole stupid state will be eating out of my hands. (realizes the camera is on) Oh, hello, friends. I'm Montgomery Burns, your next governor, and I'm here to talk to you about my little friend here, Blinky. (picks up fishbowl with Blinky in) Many of you consider it to be a hideous genetic mutation. Well, nothing could be further from the truth. But don't take my word for it. Let's ask an actor portraying Charles Darwin what he thinks. (actor enters)

DARWIN
Hello, Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Oh, hello, Charles. Be a good fellow and tell our viewers about your theory of natural selection.

DARWIN
Glad to, Mr. Burns. You see, every so often, Mother Nature changes our animals, giving them bigger teeth, sharper claws, longer legs or, in this case, a third eye. And if the variations turn out to be an improvement, the new animals thrive and multiply, and spread across the face of the earth.

BURNS
So you're saying this fish might actually have an advantage over other fish? It might actually be a kind of "Super Fish".

DARWIN
I wouldn't mind having a third eye, would you?

BURNS
(chuckling) No. you see friends, if our anti-nuclear nay-sayers and choose-upsiders were to come upon and elephant frolicking in the waters next to our nuclear power plant, they'd probably blame his ridiculous nose on the nuclear boogeyman. The truth is, this fish is a miracle of nature, with a taste that can't be beat. Mmm-mm! So, to summarize, say what you want about me. I can take the slings and arrows, but stop slandering poor, defenseless, Blinky. Good night, and God bless.

The political announcement finishes with Burns' campaign jingle:

JINGLE
Only a moron wouldn't cast his vote for Monty Burns!

The bar flies are impressed.

BARNEY
Wow! Super-Fish!

MOE
I wish the government would get off his back.

At the retirement home.

GRAMPA
That Burns is just what this state needs: Young blood!

Back at the Simpsons home.

HOMER
I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.

MARGE
Homer, I'm a Bailey Booster.

HOMER
Oh yeah? Well I'm a Burns Booster! (pins button on) Ow!

ADVISOR
Congratulations, Mr. Burns, the latest polls show you are up six points.

BURNS
Ah, giving me a total of?

ADVISOR
Six. But we're on our way.

Mary Bailey gives her own press conference.

BAILEY
My worthy opponent seems to think that the voters of this state are gullible fools. I, however, prefer to rely on their intelligence and good judgment.

REPORTER
Interesting strategy. Good luck.

BURNS
And I say taxes are too high!

Burns holds a meeting with his advisors.

BURNS
Have you, uh, found any dirt on Mary Bailey?

ADVISOR 2
Well, we've gone through her garbage

ADVISOR 3
We've talked to her maid.

ADVISOR 2
And so far, the only negative thing we've found is from some guy who dated her when she was sixteen.

BURNS
Ah. And?

ADVISOR 3
He, uh, he felt her up.

BURNS
Bah! Not good enough!

Burns gives another fiery speech.

BURNS
We're gonna send a message to those bureaucrats down there in the state capital!

Homer & Bart watch on TV.

BART
Is your boss governor yet?

HOMER
Not yet, son.

ADVISOR
The voters now see you as imperial and god-like.

BURNS
Hot dog!

ADVISOR
But there's a down-side to it. The latest polls indicate you're in danger of losing touch with the common man.

BURNS
Oh, dear! Heaven forfend!

ADVISOR
Which is why, the night before the election we want you to have dinner at the home of one of your workers.

BURNS
Oh, I get your angle. Every Joe Meatball and Sally Housecoat in this godforsaken state will see me hunkering down for chow with Eddie Punch-clock. The media will have a field day.

ADVISOR
The only question is: can we find someone common enough?

They look on the security monitors and see Homer eating, scratching himself, and belching.

BURNS
Ugh. (his advisor nods) Well, I knew there would be sacrifices.



ACT THREE
The Simpsons eat breakfast.

HOMER
Oh, great toast, Marge! Oh, by the way, the night before the election, Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.

MARGE
What!?

HOMER
Oh, and some reporters and a camera crew, but you don't have to feed them.

BART
Cool, man! A media circus!

MARGE
Absolutely not!

HOMER
Come on, Marge!

MARGE
Mm-mm. I'm going to be ringing doorbells for Mary Bailey that night.

HOMER
D'oh! Kids, pleases leave the room. I don't want you to see this.

BART
Uh-oh.

The kids zip away. Homer gets on his knees and begs.

HOMER
Please please please please please please please please please please please please...

MARGE
Mmm...

The campaign crew plaster the Simpsons house with Burns posters and the advisors prepare the family for the dinner.

ADVISOR
We're hoping that one of the children might pop up with a question about the upcoming election. Little girl, do you think you can memorize this by dinnertime tomorrow?

LISA
(reading) Mr. Burns: your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?

ADVISOR
Very good.

LISA
Mmm... well, as long as I'm asking something, can I ask him to assuage my fears that he's contaminating the planet in a manner that may one day render it uninhabitable?

ADVISOR
No, dear. The card question'll be fine.

MARGE
Well, I think the non-card question is a valid--

HOMER
Marge! (to advisor) Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, and I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinnertime tomorrow.

ADVISOR
And finally, Mr. Burns wants you to appear very affectionate towards him. But we must remind you, he hates being touched.

That evening in bed, Homer tries to snuggle with Marge, but she keeps moving over until she falls out of bed.

HOMER
Marge, get back in bed.

MARGE
No, I'm just fine right here.

HOMER
What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.

MARGE
I don't feel like snuggling.

HOMER
What's that got to do with it?

MARGE
I don't want to snuggle with anybody who's not letting me express myself.

HOMER
But you do get to express yourself! In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.

MARGE
Hmm... okay Homer. Fair enough. (getting back into bed) You've got it, alright, good. That's it, that's how I'm gonna express myself. That's right. Good night.

HOMER
Huh?

It's time for the dinner. The family, along with the pets are in make-up. A make-up man gives Homer new eyebrows.

MAKE-UP MAN
Well, what do you think?

HOMER
Hey, hello handsome!

ADVISOR
Hey! Get that stuff off his face! We're here to have dinner with the common man, not Tyrone Power.

ADVISOR 2
Latest polls are in. It's dead even, fifty-fifty.

ADVISOR
This cornball stunt is gonna put us over the top.

BART
Whoa! He's here!

Burns arrives. He rings the doorbell, and the family all come to the door.

BURNS
Hello, Homer. Marge! you look dazzling! Oh and look, I brought noodle coogle.

Suddenly, Santa's Little Helper jumps up and knocks Mr. Burns over.

HOMER
Bad dog! Bad... neighbor dog. Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns.

BURNS
(chuckling) I love dogs. Babies too.

Snowball II then dives at Burns and knocks him flying again.

BURNS
Kitty, kitty (kisses it)

HOMER
Uh, are you alright, Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Oh of course. A little roughhousing with the pets is good for a man's appetite.

They go inside and sit down at the table. Burns' advisor whispers to him.

ADVISOR
The latest polls are in. The statesman-like way you handled the pet incident has put you over the top. you're ahead fifty one to forty nine. Congratulations, Mr. Governor!

BURNS
Excellent...

HOMER
Bart, would you like to say grace?

BART
Dear God: we paid for all this stuff ourselves, so thanks for nothing.

Everyone gasps.

BURNS
(chuckling) Only an innocent child could get away with such blasphemy. God bless them all. Amen.

ADVISOR
He's smokin', he's smokin'.

HOMER
(with his mouth full, reading card) Um, you know, Mr. Burns, my family and I, um (Bart belches) feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?

BURNS
Goodness! I didn't realize this casual dinner was going to turn into a charged political debate.

HOMER
I was only reading what the card--

BURNS
Homer, I agree with you and if I'm elected governor, I will lower taxes whether those bureaucrats in the state capital like it or not! Ahem, Lisa do you have a question you would like to ask your uncle Montgomery?

LISA
Yes, sir, a very inane one. Mr. Burns, your campaign seems to have the momentum of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?

BURNS
Ooh, a tough question but a fair one. Lisa, there's no single answer. Some voters respond to my integrity, others are more impressed with my incorruptibility. (Lisa leaves the table) Still others buy my determination to lower taxes. And the bureaucrats in the state capital can put that in their pipes and smoke it!

Lisa is in the kitchen.

LISA
Oh Mom, that felt awful.

MARGE
Mmm... I'm sorry dear. It will all be over soon.

LISA
But Mom, we've become the tools of evil.

MARGE
Lisa, you're learning many lessons tonight, and one of them is to always give your mother the benefit of the doubt.

They go back into the dining room with the main course, where Burns is still ranting.

BURNS
...give a decent break, or a fair shake, or even a square deal. Mmm, smells delightful.

Marge lifts up the cover off the plate. The main course is three-eyed fish. Everyone gasps.

BART
Alright, three-eyed fish!

MARGE
Can I have your plate, Mr. Burns?

Burns shudders and gives her his plate. He takes one bite of the fish and spits it out. As it flies through the air, the reporters flash their cameras and leave before it hits the ground.

REPORTER
He's blown it for sure.

ADVISOR
Ruined before it hit the ground.

Outside.

SHUTTON
(on phone) Get me the city desk.

REPORTER
(on phone) Here's you're headline, Phil: "Burns Can't Swallow Own Story".

The family, Burns and his advisors watch the news report.

SCOTT CHRISTIAN
The latest polls indicate Burns' popularity has plummeted to Earth like so much half-chewed fish.

BURNS
You must have a few tricks up your sleeve. Smithers, boil some coffee, we're not licked yet.

ADVISOR
Yes we are. Come on boys, the old guy's finished. (they leave)

BURNS
Wait, come back! You can't do this to me! I'M CHARLES MONTGOMERY BURNS!

He starts wrecking the Simpsons home. He tries to turn a table over, but can't.

BURNS
Smithers, turn over this table for me.

SMITHERS
Yes, sir. (does so)

MARGE
Homer, make him stop!

HOMER
Uh, Mr. Burns? Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Shut up and wreck something!

Homer does so. Lisa intervenes.

LISA
Mr. Burns? I hardly see what destroying our meager possessions is going to accomplish.

BURNS
She's right. Take me home, Smithers. We'll destroy something tasteful. (walks outside) Ironic, isn't it, Smithers. This anonymous clan of slack-jawed troglodytes has cost me the election, and yet if I were to have them killed, I would be the one to go to jail. That's democracy for you.

SMITHERS
You are noble and poetic in defeat, sir.

BURNS
(to Homer, in the doorway) Simpson, I shall make it the focus of my remaining years that your dreams will go unfulfilled.

BART
Uh-oh, you're busted, Dad!

Later that night, Homer sits in bed, worrying.

HOMER
Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled? Oh, no! I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better please, can't you make it better, huh?

MARGE
Homer, when a man's biggest dreams include seconds on dessert, occasional snuggling and sleeping in til noon on weekends, no one man can destroy them.

HOMER
Hey, you did it!

They kiss, Marge turns the light off, and the credits roll.


#### SET 4 ####
ACT ONE
Kent Brockman delivers the news.

KENT
(chuckling) ...which if true, means death for us all. And now, "Kent's People!" Tonight's inspiring story is about Frank Grimes, a thirty-five-year-old Springfieldianite who's earned everything the hard way, but never let adversity get him down.

We see a young boy in the back seat of a car.

KENT
Abandoned by his parents at age four, Frank never got to go to school.

In fact, Grimes is not in the car, he is stood behind as the car drives off. More pictures accompany the story.

KENT
He spent his childhood years as a delivery boy, delivering toys to more fortunate children. Then, on his eighteenth birthday, he was blown up in a silo explosion.

We see a Grimes running into a silo, which then explodes. Cut to Grimes in hospital, bandaged from head to toe.

KENT
During his long recuperation he taught himself to hear and feel pain again. As the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day to study science by mail. And, last week, Frank Grimes, the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got, received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics -- with a minor in determination.

An eagle tries to take the diploma from Grimes, but he fights it off. We see Mr. Burns is watching the show.

BURNS
That's the kind of man I need on my team, Smithers. A real scrapper. A self-made man, like me. Bring this Grimes fellow to me. I want to make him my Executive Vice President.

SMITHERS
Yes, Sir.

The next day, Burns watches television again. Smithers brings in Frank Grimes.

BURNS
Smithers, I've just seen the most heroic dog on television. He pulled a toddler from the path of a speeding car, then pushed a criminal in front of it. Find this dog. I want to make him my Executive Vice President.

SMITHERS
Uh, yes sir. In the meantime, here's Frank Grimes. (Burns stares blankly.) The self-made man?

BURNS
What? Oh, yes, that fellow. Mmm, put him somewhere out of the way, and find that dog!

SMITHERS
Yes sir.

At his workstation, Homer is spinning around in his swivel chair. Lenny and Carl enter.

HOMER
Chair goes round, chair goes round.

LENNY
Hey Homie, you busy?

HOMER
Yes.

CARL
There's a new guy at the plant. Uh, maybe we oughta say hi to him.

HOMER
Oh, I don't know. I'm kinda dizzy. I should probably go home sick.

In his office, Grimes arranges his belongings. Homer, Lenny, and Carl press their faces against the office window, then walk in.

CARL
You new?

GRIMES
Yes. My name is Frank Grimes.

LENNY
I'm Lenny. This is Carl and Homer. I'm Lenny.

GRIMES
How do you do.

Homer picks up one of Grimes' pencils, spilling the rest of them on the desk.

HOMER
Wow, you've got pencils with your name on them, just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.

GRIMES
(taking the pencil back) Any office supply company can have them made up for you.

HOMER
Can I have this one?

GRIMES
No.

HOMER
Can... (thinks) Lenny have it?

GRIMES
No.

Lenny and Carl look at Grimes' diploma.

GRIMES
Oh, that's my degree in nuclear physics. I'm sure you all have one.

LENNY
Oh yeah, Carl and I each have a masters. Of course, old Homer, he didn't need a degree. He just showed up the day they opened the plant.

HOMER
I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.

GRIMES
(forced laugh) Uh, yeah. Well, listen, I'm sure, you all have a lot of work to do.

Lenny and Carl shrug and leave. Grimes turns around, and sees Homer is still there.

HOMER
Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.

GRIMES
Uh, I don't think we're being paid to sleep.

HOMER
Oh yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.

Homer leaves. Grimes shudders.

At the DMV, Marge is trying to get a personalized licensed plate. Bart is with her, looking bored.

MARGE
Marge is already taken! How about Marjorie?

CLERK
Uh. Sorry ma'am.

MARGE
Mmm... how about Mitzy?

CLERK
Nuh-uh. Uh, you can have Nitzy.

MARGE
Hmm... Nitzy.

BART
I'm outta here.

Bart leaves. He walks into an auction of Tax Seizures.

AUCTIONEER
Ladies and gentlemen, our next lot is number seven-fifty-one. How much am I bid for number seven-fifty-one? Seven-five-one. Nothing? No bids for item seven-fifty-one?

BART
A buck!

AUCTIONEER
I got a buck, I got a dollar here, one dollar there... (continues talking very quickly in typical auctioneer-style) Sold, for a buck.

BART
Cool, what'd I buy?

AUCTIONEER
35 Industry Way.

Bart turns up at the property, which is an old factory.

BART
Looks like my years of hard work have finally paid off.

It is lunchtime at the power plant. Homer is in the canteen, when Grimes enters.

HOMER
Hiya Stretch, what's the good word?

GRIMES
My name is Grimes, uh, Simpson. Frank Grimes. I took the trouble to learn your name, so the least you could do is learn mine.

HOMER
Okay, Grimey.

GRIMES
Uh, you're eating my special diabetic lunch.

HOMER
Huh? (looks at the bag and chuckles) Oh, I'm sorry.

GRIMES
The bag was clearly marked. Please be more careful in the future.

HOMER
Check.

Homer takes a few more bites before handing it back to Grimes. Grimes tosses the remainder in the trash and walks away. Homer reaches out to retrieve it, but stops and looks innocent when Grimes turns around to look. Grimes then returns to his office, where he finds his pencils have been chewed.

GRIMES
Simpson, do you know who chewed my--

He sees Homer chewing several, and using one to clean his ears. Grimes walks off, growling.

Meanwhile, Bart looks round his factory. It is very big and empty.

BART
Wow. It's filthy, and it's mine, haha.

Bart picks up a bolt and aims it towards a window on the far side of the room. It lands on the other side of the room. Bart then sees an old swivel chair, and a fire extinguisher. He wheels the chair into position, sits down, and uses the fire extinguisher to jet-propel himself across the factory floor and into the wall.

BART
Wheeeeeee!

Back at the power plant, Homer enters Grimes' office.

HOMER
So, how's it going, Grimey?

GRIMES
I... I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, Simpson.

HOMER
(laughing) Wish I had a nickel every time I've heard that.

Homer idly wanders around the office, whistling and making annoying sounds.

HOMER
(singing) Take me out to the ball-game, take me out to the ball... Ah, what's new, Grimey?

Suddenly, an alarm goes off and lights flash in Homer's workstation next door.

GRIMES
Simpson, you've got a five-thirteen.

Homer looks at his watch.

GRIMES
No, a five-thirteen. In your procedures manual... a five-thirteen?

Homer looks at his watch again.

GRIMES
(pointing) Look at your control panel!

HOMER
(looks) Oh, a five THIR-teen. I'll handle it.

Homer goes to his workstation, takes a bucket of water and pours it on the console. This shorts it out and silences the alarms

HOMER
That got it.

Grimes looks on in disbelief.

Bart sits in an office in his factory. Milhouse walks past. Bart leans out of the window and whistles to him.

BART
Hey, Milhouse! You want a job in my factory?

MILHOUSE
You don't a have a factory!

BART
Hey, I'm a busy man. You want a job or not?

MILHOUSE
Okay!

Homer wolfs down his lunch. Grimes looks on in disbelief.

GRIMES
God, he eats like a pig.

LENNY
I dunno. Pigs tend to chew. I'd say he eats more like a duck.

GRIMES
Well, some kind of farm animal anyway. And earlier today, I saw him asleep inside a radiation suit. Heh, can you imagine that, he... he was hanging from a coat hook.

LENNY
He had three beers at lunch. That would make anybody sleepy.

GRIMES
I've never seen him do any work around here ... what, what is his job?

LENNY
Safety inspector.

GRIMES
That irresponsible oaf? A man who by all rights should have been killed dozens of times by now?

LENNY
Three hundred and sixteen times by my count.

GRIMES
That's the man who's in charge of our safety? It... it boggles the mind.

CARL
It's best not to think about it.

Homer reaches out for a drink, but picks up a beaker of sulphuric acid. He is about to drink it when Grimes smashes it out of his hand and into a wall, causing the wall to dissolve.

GRIMES
Aah! You idiot! You nearly drank a beaker full of sulphuric acid!

HOMER
Acid, eh? Jeez, that would've been stupid! (laughs) Boy would my face have been red. (laughs more)

GRIMES
Stop laughing, you imbecile! Don't you realize how close you just came to killing yourself?!

Mr. Burns and a dog, wearing a sash labeled "Executive Vice President" walk by. Burns sees the hole in the wall.

BURNS
Who did this to my wall?

HOMER
(pointing to Grimes) He did.

BURNS
Is this true?

GRIMES
Well, uh, technically it is true, sir, but--

BURNS
Come with me.

HOMER
(whispering to Grimes) He likes you.

Homer gives Grimes the thumbs up. Cut to outside Burn's office, where we hear the conversation. The dog barks.

BURNS
How dare you destroy my valuable wall! And spill my priceless acid! Did you really think you were going to get away with it?

GRIMES
I wasn't--

BURNS
Silence! I am going to give you one more chance... at a reduced salary. So straighten up and fly right!

GRIMES
But sir if I c--

The dog barks again. Grimes confronts Homer at his work station.

HOMER
Hi Grimey, old buddy.

GRIMES
I'm not your buddy, Simpson. I don't like you. In fact, I hate you! Stay the hell away from me, because from now on, we're enemies!

HOMER
(quietly) Okay. Do I have to do anything?

GRIMES
Grrr!

He shudders and leaves.



ACT TWO
Homer is at Moe's.

HOMER
Oh, I can't believe it, I got an enemy. Me, the most beloved man in Springfield.

MOE
Ah, it's a weird world, Homer. As hard as it is to believe, some people don't care for me, neither.

HOMER
No, I won't accept that.

MOE
Nah, it's true. I got their names written down right here on what I call my, uh, "enemies list."

Moe reaches under the bar and brings out a piece of paper. Barney reads it.

BARNEY
Jane Fonda, Daniel Shore, Jack Anderson... hey! This is Richard Nixon's enemies list. You just crossed out his name and put yours.

MOE
Okay, gimme that, gimme it back. (writes on the paper) Barney Gumble.

BARNEY
Oh.

HOMER
Oh, what'll I do, Moe?

MOE
Uh, why don't you invite him over to dinner. Turn him from an enemy to a friend. Then when he's not expecting it... bam! The old fork in the eye.

HOMER
Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?

MOE
There's always a first time.

At the Simpsons' home. The family are dressed up for dinner.

HOMER
This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimey and me are going to be friends. (turns to Lisa) Lisa, be perfect.

LISA
Okay.

HOMER
(to Marge) Marge. Perfect. (to Bart) Bart. Perfect. (to Maggie) Other kid. Perfect.

MARGE
We only have 5 lobsters. Are you sure he's not bringing anyone with him?

HOMER
No. No. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.

The doorbell rings and Homer starts flailing his arms.

HOMER
It's him! It's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him it's him!

MARGE
Calm down, Homer! Calm down, answer the door.

Homer answers the door.

HOMER
(nervously) Welcome to the Simpson residence or "casa de Simpson," as I call it, heh heh.

GRIMES
Yeah, what did you want to see me about, Simpson? This better be important.

HOMER
It is, it is, but first, let me introduce you to my family, my perfect family. This is my wife Marge...

MARGE
Hello.

HOMER
And our beautiful baby... (Maggie sucks her pacifier) ...my daughter Lisa, IQ a hundred and fifty six.

LISA
(curtsies) Hi.

HOMER
See? And my son Bart... (Bart winks) He owns a factory downtown.

GRIMES
How do you do. Uh, look Homer, I'm, I'm late for my night job at the foundry so if you don't mind telling me--

He stop as he notices the house.

GRIMES
Good Heavens! Th-this is a palace! How c-- how can, how in the world can you afford to live in a house like this, Simpson?

HOMER
I dunno. Don't as me how the economy works.

GRIMES
Yeah, but look at the size of this place! I... I live in a single room above a bowling alley and (muttering) below another bowling alley.

HOMER
Wow!

Grimes notices some pictures on the wall.

GRIMES
I'm sorry, isn't that--

HOMER
Yes, that's me alright. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. (pointing to the other photos) And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins. Oh! And here's a picture of me in outer space.

GRIMES
You? Went into outer space? You?

HOMER
Sure. You've never been? Would you like to see my Grammy award? (holds it up)

GRIMES
No! I wouldn't! God, I've had to work hard every day of my life, and what do I have to show for it? This briefcase, and this haircut! And what do you have to show for your lifetime of sloth and ignorance?

HOMER
What?

GRIMES
Everything! A dream house! Two cars! A beautiful wife! A son who owns a factory! Fancy clothes and (sniffs air) lobsters for dinner! And do you deserve any of it? No!

HOMER
(gasps) What are you saying?

GRIMES
I'm saying you're what's wrong with America, Simpson. You coast through life, you do as little as possible, and you leech off of decent, hardworking people like me. Heh, if you lived in any other country in the world, you'd have starved to death long ago.

BART
He's got you there, dad.

GRIMES
You're a fraud. A-- a total fraud. (walks out, pokes his head back round the doorway, and speaks to Marge and the kids) It was nice meeting you.

Grimes leaves again, slamming the front door.

The next day, Bart and Milhouse are at the factory again.

MILHOUSE
Wow. Adding machines. Industrial waste. What should we do with all this stuff, Bart?

BART
I think we both know the answer to that.

The boys throw the machines into a the barrels of industrial waste, and watch them dissolve. Later, Milhouse mops the floor. He pauses to wipe his brow.

BART
Get to work!

Next, they stand atop a rickety staircase, rocking it.

BART &MILHOUSE
Wacky shack!

MILHOUSE
Better be careful, Bart. Look at those warning signs.

He indicates some sign on the "Wacky Shack." Bart pulls them off and chucks them out the window.

BART
Solve your problem Milhouse?

MILHOUSE
Yep.

Marge walks around the front of the house to find Homer sitting in his car on the driveway. She taps on the window.

MARGE
Homer? (taps again) Homer, why aren't you at work?

HOMER
The car won't start. I don't feel very good today. I am at work.

MARGE
You're afraid to go to work because Frank Grimes will be there, aren't you?

HOMER
That's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road!

He honks the horn. Marge gets in the car.

MARGE
You'll have to face him sometime, and when you do I'm sure he'll be just as anxious to make up as you are.

HOMER
No he won't, he hates me.

MARGE
He doesn't hate you. He just feels insecure because you're getting through life so easily, and it's been so difficult for him.

HOMER
Yeah, yeah, that's his problem, he's a nut! It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut.

MARGE
Well... maybe. But I bet he would be less crazy if you were just a little more, um, professional in your work. (Homer gasps) Just a little more! Then he won't have any reason to resent you.

HOMER
I'll do it! (pulls out a bottle of Duff) To professionalism!

Homer drinks the whole bottle.

At work, Homer eats donuts at his workstation... with a knife and fork. On his wall hangs a picture of him with the words: "Mr. Good Employee" on it. Grimes walks past.

HOMER
Good morning fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson.

Grimes isn't impressed, and leaves. An alarm sounds at Homer's workstation. Grimes joins Lenny and Carl in the break room.

GRIMES
Can you believe that guy? He's in his office making a pathetic attempt to look professional.

CARL
Hey, what do you got against Homer, anyway?

GRIMES
Are you kidding? Does this whole plant have some disease where it can't see that he's an idiot? Look here. (points to a graph on the bulletin board) Accidents have doubled every year since he became safety inspector, and, and meltdowns have tripled. Has he been fired? No. Has he been disciplined? No, no.

LENNY
Eh, everybody makes mistakes. That's why they put erasers on pencils.

CARL
Yeah, Homer's okay. Give him a break.

GRIMES
No! Homer is not okay. And I want everyone in this plant to realize it. I would die a happy man if I could prove to you that Homer Simpson has the intelligence of a six-year-old.

LENNY
(to Carl) So, how are you doing?

Grimes begins to leave, but notices a poster on the bulletin board, advertising a children's contest to build the best model of a new power plant.

GRIMES
Oh, here we go.

Grimes takes the notice to his office, where he carefully cuts away all references to this being a contest for kids. Then he places the notice at Homer's workstation.

HOMER
Oh. Design your own power planet, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am. (to a picture of Lenny on his desk) Lenny, tell Mr. burns I've gone home to work on the contest.

As Homer gets into his car to leave, Grimes watches through an upstairs window, laughing. Homer backs into Grimes' car.

GRIMES
Oh god.



ACT THREE
At the Simpsons' home. We hear sounds of sawing, hammering, and Homer cussing from the basement. Lisa & Marge are in the kitchen.

LISA
Can I go downstairs and see what Dad's doing?

MARGE
I wouldn't bother him, honey. He's making some kind of model for a contest. He says it's really high-tech stuff that we wouldn't understand.

HOMER
(opens basement door) Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?

At the factory, Milhouse pounds on a furnace. Bart pulls the traditional steam whistle, indicating the end of the working day, and Milhouse gets ready to leave.

MILHOUSE
Oh boy! Quittin' time!

BART
Just a minute, van Houten. Somebody needs to guard this place tonight so it doesn't get trashed. (handing him a cap and baton) How'd you like to be night watchman?

MILHOUSE
I'm sleepy.

BART
Ah, no problemo. Here's a nickel for the coffee machine.

Bart gives him the money and leaves. Milhouse puts the nickel in the machine. It dispenses a cup, then a rat (which runs off), then some coffee. Milhouse drinks the coffee, and gazes around.

MILHOUSE
So this is my life. At least I've done better than Dad.

The next day, Bart heads back to the factory, to find a huge pile of rubble on the spot.

BART
Ah, jeez. Milhouse, how could you let this happen? You were supposed to be the night watchman.

MILHOUSE
I was watchin'. I saw the whole thing. First it started falling over, then it fell over.

BART
Wow. I wonder where all the rats are gonna go?

Dozens of rats run out from under the rubble and into Moe's Tavern. We hear Moe's voice from outside.

MOE
Okay, everybody tuck your pants into your socks.

At the power plant, it's time for the model-building contest in the auditorium. Mr. Burns judges the models.

BURNS
(to the audience of workers) ...and the bold new ideas these tiny tykes unveil for us today could make thousands of jobs like yours... obsolete!

There is some weak applause.

SMITHERS
Our first little genius is Ralph Wiggum.

Ralph comes on stage with a modified Malibu Stacy Dream House.

SMITHERS
It's pretty good sir.

BURNS
Hot tub? Media room? It's supposed to be a power plant not Aunt Beulah's bordello. Thank you. Get out. Next!

Ralph doesn't move. Chief Wiggum calls from off screen.

WIGGUM
Uh, Ralphie, get off the stage sweetheart!

Ralph takes the doll house and leaves. Martin Prince is up next.

MARTIN
Behold, the power plant of the future, today!

BURNS
Yuck. Too cold and sterile. Where's the heart?

MARTIN
But it really generates power. It, it's lighting this room right now.

He turns a knob, dimming the auditorium lights.

BURNS
You lose. Get off my property. Lets have the next child.

Homer brings his model on stage.

GRIMES
(calling from the audience) Look everybody! Simpson's in a contest with children.

LENNY
Hey, shh!

CARL
You're making us miss the contest.

BURNS
Could you explain your model, young man?

GRIMES
What's to explain? He's an idiot!

LENNY
Pipe down!

HOMER
Well basically, I just copied the plant we have now.

BURNS
Mm-hmm.

HOMER
Then, I added some fins to lower wind resistance. (pointing) And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.

BURNS
Agreed. First prize!

Burns gives Homer a blue ribbon and some money.

GRIMES
What?

CARL
Way to go, Homer!

LENNY
You're number one, Homer!

GRIMES
But it, it was contest for children!

LENNY
Yeah. And Homer beat their brains out!

The audience cheers wildly.

GRIMES
Oh, I, I can't stand it any longer. This whole plant is insane. Insane, I tell you! Daahh! Aaah!

Grimes runs out of the auditorium, and into an equipment room.

GRIMES
I can be lazy too!

Grimes takes his tie off, and moons one of the technicians.

GRIMES
Hi, look at me, I am a worthless employee, just like Homer Simpson! Give me a promotion!

Grimes walks into the break room, and grabs two donuts from the box.

GRIMES
Ooh, I eat like a slob, but nobody minds!

Grimes scoffs down the donuts, then heads to the bathroom.

GRIMES
(off screen) I'm peeing on the seat. Give me a raise!

Grimes emerges from the bathroom and waves his hands in Homer's face.

GRIMES
Now I'm returning to work without washing my hands. But it doesn't matter, because I'm Homer Simpson!

Grimes runs to Homer's workstation and spins around in the chair.

GRIMES
I don't need to do my work, 'cause someone else will do it for me. (slaps himself on the forehead) D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

HOMER
Hey, you okay, Grimey?

GRIMES
I'm better than okay, I'm Homer Simpson.

HOMER
(chuckles) You wish.

Mr. Burns walks in.

GRIMES
Oh, hi, Mr. Burns. I'm the worst worker in the world. Time to go home to my mansion and eat my lobster!

He sees some dangerous-looking wires  on the wall.

GRIMES
What's this? (reads sign) "Extremely High Voltage"? Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp--

Grimes grabs the wires and is electrocuted. The scene cuts to Grimes' tombstone - it is his funeral. Reverend Lovejoy delivers the eulogy.

LOVEJOY
Frank Grimes, or "Grimey," as he liked to be called, taught us that a man can triumph over adversity. And even though Frank's agonizing struggle through life was tragically cut short, I'm sure he's looking down on this right now...

Lovejoy's voice fades as the camera pans to a sleeping Homer.

HOMER
(snores) Change the channel, Marge!

The mourners laugh.

LENNY
That's our Homer!

Everybody laughs as Grimes' coffin is lowered into the ground. Fade to credits.


#### SET 5 ####
ACT ONE
The episode starts in a large mansion. Senator Medoza taps his glass to call attention to his dinner guests.

MENDOZA
My friends, tonight we unveil my most diabolical creation: Swank. Ten times more addictive than marijuana.

GUESTS
Ooh!

MENDOZA
To human misery!

Suddenly, the ice sculpture bursts and TV action hero McBain bursts out.

MCBAIN
Ice to see you!

MENDOZA
McBain!

He starts firing round after round from his machine gun, killing practically everyone in the room. Everyone except Mendoza, that is.

MENDOZA
Ah, McBain, so glad you could make it. (hands him a plate with food on) Have a salmon puff.

MCBAIN
Alright.

He takes one and bites into it. Some kind of gas sprays out, incapacitating McBain. He screams and falls unconscious. Mendoza laughs evilly. It turns out Homer & Bart are watching this movie.

BART
That is one evil dude.

HOMER
It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life.

Cut to Mr. Burns office, where an employee clings from a rope outside his window. Burns laughs evilly. He closes the blind and we hear the man screaming as he falls. Burns calls Smithers.

BURNS
Smithers, where is that union representative? He's twenty minutes late!

SMITHERS
I don't know, sir. He hasn't been seen since he promised to clean up the union.

Cut to a football pitch where a player trip over a freshly dug human-shaped mound of earth.

PLAYER
What the Hell?

Back to the office.

BURNS
Well let's look at the contract ourselves. (reading) Benefits? Perks? A green cookie on Saint Patrick's Day? Ho ho, it didn't used to be this way, Smithers. No, it didn't used to be this way at all...

He recalls visiting the factory in his childhood years with his grandfather, when people smashed atoms by hand. Burns' grandfather pulls aside a worker.

BURNS' GRANDFATHER
Come on, come on! Crack those atoms! You, turn out your pockets. (worker does so) Atoms! (counts them) One, two three, four... six of them! Take him away!

WORKER
(squeaky, annoying voice) You can't treat the working man this way. One day, we'll form a union and get the fair and equitable treatment we deserve! Then we'll go too far, and get corrupt and shiftless, and the Japanese will eat us alive!

BURNS' GRANDFATHER
The Japanese?! Those sandal-wearing goldfish-tenders? Bosh, flim-shaw!

Back to the present day.

BURNS
If only we'd listened to that boy, instead of walling him up in the abandoned coke oven. Well, I'm going to avenge my grandfather. We'll take on that greedy union, and we'll get back our... (points at a random line) Dental Plan.

At the Painless Dentistry (formerly Painful Dentistry), the dentist interrogates Ralph.

DR. WOLFE
How often do you brush, Ralph?

RALPH
Three times a day, sir.

DR. WOLFE
(menacingly) Why must you turn my office into a house of lies?

RALPH
Alright, I don't brush! (crying) I don't brush!

DR. WOLFE
Let's look at a picture book - the Big Book of British Smiles.

He shows him a book of people with crooked and missing teeth.

RALPH
That's enough! (crying) That's enough!

In the waiting room, Bart talks to several kids.

BART
Dr. Wolfe likes to pull kids' teeth so he can sell 'em.

KID
To who?

BART
Know that rattle when you shake up a can of spray paint? That's a kid's tooth!

The kids shudder. Next the dentist consults the Simpsons kids. He inspects Maggie's mouth.

DR. WOLFE
Maggie's teeth are coming in rather crooked. Has she been sucking on a pacifier?

MARGE
Uh... not to my knowledge.

DR. WOLFE
Liar!

A little while later.

DR. WOLFE
I'm also afraid little Lisa is going to need braces.

LISA
Oh no! I'll be socially unpopular! (pause) More so.

MARGE
Are you sure, doctor?

DR. WOLFE
Well, judge for yourself. (showing a computer image) Here's Lisa today. Without treatment, here's what she'll look like at age 11... age 14... age 17... and finally, age 18.

The last picture shows a huge tooth has grown up through her face. Lisa gasps.

BART
Cool! she'll be a freak!

MARGE
Bart!

BART
We can stick her in a trailer, drive around the south and charge two bits a gander.

Homer watches wrestling on television.

TV ANNOUNCER
Now stay tuned for professional wrestling live from Springfield Grappelarium. Tonight a Texas death match: Dr. Hillbilly versus the Iron Yuppie. One man will actually be unmasked and killed in the ring!

HOMER
I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.

Marge and the kids enter.

MARGE
Homer, Lisa needs braces.

HOMER
Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of '88. (indicating scar) That's where I got this scar.

Flashback to the strike. The employees protest.

CARL
What do we want?

EMPLOYEES
More equitable treatment at the hands of management!

CARL
When do we want it?

EMPLOYEES
Soon!

Pan across to Homer at the snack cart.

HOMER
Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? (awning collapses and hits him in the head) Ow!

Back to present, and Homer points out another scar.

HOMER
Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.

At the Union meeting.

CARL
Welcome, brothers of Local 643. As you know, our president, Chuckie Fitzhugh, ain't been seen lately. We're all prayin' he'll turn up soon, alive and well. (everyone laughs) All right, all right. But seriously, we have to vote of Burns' new contract. It's basically the same deal, except we get a free keg of beer for our meetings. (everyone cheers) In exchange for that, we have to give up our dental plan.

Everyone cheers and rushes over to the beer keg. Lenny pours a beer.

LENNY
So long Dental Plan!

Lenny's and Marge words keep repeating in Homer's head.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

Charlie drops a pencil into Homer's butt crack.

CARL
Bullseye!

HOMER
Thanks a lot, Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

LENNY'S VOICE
Dental Plan!

MARGE
Lisa needs braces.

HOMER
(finally realizing) If we give up our dental plan... I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces! (to everyone) People, stop! We can't give up our Dental Plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth.

Lenny smiles and someone steals the diamond

MAN
Yoink!

LENNY
Hey!

HOMER
And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the Dental Plan?

GUMMY JOE
I wouldn't have old "chopper" here. that's for sure.

He pierces a can of soda with his solitary tooth.

HOMER
You know what I think of this contract? This!

He rips it to shreds. A secret camera focuses on him. Burns and Smithers watch on the monitor.

BURNS
Who is that firebrand, Smithers?

SMITHERS
That's Homer Simpson.

BURNS
Simpson, eh? New man?

SMITHERS
Actually, sir, he thwarted your campaign for governor, you ran over his son, he saved the plant from meltdown, his wife painted you in the nude...

BURNS
Doesn't ring a bell.

Back in the Union room.

ALL
Homer! Homer! Homer!

CARL
I move that Homer Simpson be out new Union President. All in favor?

ALL
Aye!

CARL
All opposed?

MEEK VOICE
(from back of crowd somewhere) Nay.

CARL
Congratulations, Homer.

The crowd picks Homer up, cheering.

HOMER
Hey, what does this job pay?

CARL
Nothing.

HOMER
D'oh!

CARL
Unless you're crooked.

HOMER
Woo-hoo!



ACT TWO
The Simpsons eat breakfast.

MARGE
President of the Union? I'm so proud of you, Homie.

LISA
This is your chance to get a fair shake for the working man.

HOMER
And make life-long connections to the world of organized crime. Mmm... organized crime...

Homer imagines himself as Italian "Don Homer".

MAN
Don Homer, I have baked a special donut just-a for you.

DON HOMER
(tries it) Mmm... graci

WOMAN
Don Homer, my son, he has a-trouble with the--

DON HOMER
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. (takes a donut) Molto bene.

Back to reality, Homer is still dreaming.

HOMER
That's a nice a-donut.

MARGE
Do you think you can get back the Dental Plan back?

HOMER
Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator: Mr. Burns or me.

BART
Dad, I'll trade you this delicious doorstop for your crummy old Danish.

HOMER
(trading) Done and done. (chuckles, then he realizes) D'oh!

Lisa & Marge return to the dentist.

DR. WOLFE
Lisa and Marge, these braces are invisible, painless, and periodically release a delightful burst of Calvin Klein's Obsession... for Teeth.

LISA
(smelling) Mmm!

MARGE
Uh, doctor, we don't have a dental plan right now, so we'll need something a little more... affordable.

DR. WOLFE
(pulling out a mess of metal) These predate stainless steel, so you can't get them wet.

Mr. Burns watches Homer on his monitor.

BURNS
He's a worthy foe. Look at him, Smithers. Exercising away while the others are off at the candy machine.

From behind, however, we see that Homer is just struggling to reach a Sugar Daddy stuck to his back.

HOMER
Hey Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?

LENNY
Okay, but it's the last time!

Burns chats to Homer in his office.

BURNS
We don't have to be adversaries, Homer. We both want a fair union contract.

HOMER
(thinking) Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?

BURNS
And if you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.

HOMER
(thinking) Wait a minute. Is he coming onto me?

BURNS
I mean, if I should slip something into your pocket, what's the harm?

HOMER
(thinking) Oh my God! He is coming onto me!

BURNS
After all, negotiations make strange bedfellows. (winks)

HOMER
(thinking) Aah! (aloud) Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!

He walks out.

Back at the dentist. Dr. Wolfe is ready to put Lisa's braces in.

DR. WOLFE
Lisa, so you won't be scared, I'll show you some of the tools I'll be using. This is the scraper. This is the poker. And this happy little fellow... is the gouger. Now the first thing I'll be doing is chiseling some teeth out of your jawbone. Hold still while I gas you.

Lisa is anesthetized, and dreams. She floats happily through the air and passes over strange landscapes a la Yellow Submarine. The Beatles even make an appearance.

RINGO
Look, fella0, it's Lisa in the sky.

MCCARTNEY
No diamonds, though.

HARRISON
Look out for the campy drawing of Queen Victoria!

The crash and shout "Help us!".

Lisa wakes up, asking for the mirror.

LISA
The mirror. (impatiently) The mirror!

Wolfe gives it to her. Lisa cackles evilly, then smashes the mirror. Back at home, Marge comforts Lisa.

MARGE
Honey, you look fine.

Santa's Little Helper comes bounding up to Lisa, but when she smiles, the dog runs away scared. Lisa trudges upstairs. The doorbell rings and Homer goes to answer it.

HOMER
Who is it?

VOICE
Goons.

HOMER
Who?

VOICE
Hired Goons.

HOMER
(opening door) Hired Goons?

The goons grab Homer roughly and take him away. One steps back into the doorway and shakes his tie. They take him to Burns' Mansion.

BURNS
Ah, Homer I hope "Crusher" and "Low Blow" didn't hurt you.

HOMER
Y'know, you could have just called me.

BURNS
Oh yes, but the telephone is so impersonal. I prefer the hands-on touch you only get with hired goons.

HOMER
Hired Goons?

Burns gives Homer the grand tour.

BURNS
This is the largest TV in the free world.

He turns it on. The bumblebee guy is on. He goes to his bed to find a skunk there.

BUMBLEBEE GUY
Aye! Un gato marodoro!

They enter another room, full of monkeys chained to typewriters.

BURNS
This is a thousand monkeys working at a thousand typewriters. Soon, they'll have written the greatest novel known to mankind. (reads one of the typewriters) "It was the best of times, it was the blurst of times"?! you stupid monkey! (monkey screeches) Oh, shut up.

They finish in a dingy basement.

BURNS
And this is my basement.

HOMER
Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.

BURNS
Yes, I really should stop ending the tour with it. Now, let's get down to business.

HOMER
(thinking) Oh, man. I really have to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?

A leaking pipe drips water in the background, and Smithers pours a cup of coffee.

BURNS
Now Homer, I know what you're thinking, and I want to take the pressure off. It doesn't take a whiz to know that you're looking out for number one. Well, listen to me, and you'll make a big splash very soon.

HOMER
Ooh, which way to the bathroom?

BURNS
Oh, it's the twenty-third door on the left.

Homer runs down a long corridor, checking every door.

HOMER
Nope. Nope. Nope.

BURNS
Ah, he wouldn't even hear me out. (Homer returns) Find the bathroom alright?

HOMER
Uh... yeah...

Burns brings Homer home in his helicopter. Marge rushes out to greet him and her hair is chopped off by the blades.

BURNS
(menacing) Well, you've won this round Simpson, but I'll ground you into the earth like a bug! (helicopter takes off, but he falls out) Aah! (Homer & Marge rush over) Simpson, be a dear and rub my legs until the feeling comes back.

Burns is soon on a stretcher and carried away dangling from the helicopter.

BURNS
A bug, I tell you, a bug!!

He laughs evilly as his stretcher hits the side of a house in the distance.

HOMER
Ugh, I'm going to resign. I don't know why they made me union president in the first place.

MARGE
Because they love you down at the plant!

HOMER
Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck, pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh.

MARGE
Mmm... it doesn't sound like they like you at all.

HOMER
You know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm going to punch Lenny in the back of the head.

The next morning, Lenny is drinking a cup of coffee. Homer punches him in the back of the head.

At Springfield Elementary, it's picture day.

SKINNER
Button down those cowlicks! Straighten that part! Uncross those eyes, mister!

KID
But I can't!

SKINNER
Oh. Sorry, Quigley.

Lisa is about to have her picture taken.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Come on honey, smile! I bet you've got a beautiful smile. Why don't you share it with the world? (Lisa smiles, revealing her braces, the photographer gasps) There is no God!

He takes a photo of Lisa sad.

Another Union meeting.

HOMER
Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night, and I've had enough.

ALL
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

CARL
All in favor of a strike?

ALL
Aye!

CARL
All opposed?

MEEK VOICE
Nay.

HOMER
Who keeps saying that?

The crowd parts to reveal a meek guy and a big guy at the back of the room. The meek guy speaks.

MAN
(pointing to big guy) It was him. Let's get him, fellas.

Everyone beats up the big guy. The meek guy chuckles.



ACT THREE
Outside the power plant, Lisa plays guitar and sings a protest song to inspire the strikers.

LISA
Come gather 'round children,
It's high time ye learned,
'Bout a hero named Homer,
And a devil named Burns.
We'll march till we drop,
The girls and the fellas,
We'll fight till the death
Or else fold like umbrellas.

Strikers rock Chief Wiggum's car.

WIGGUM
(inside) Ah, this is the life.

Burns watches on the balcony.

BURNS
Smithers, get me some strikebreakers. The kind they had in the thirties.

Abe Simpson and the other pensioners are in Burns' office. Burns and Smithers look pretty bored.

ABE
We can't bust heads like we used to, but we have our ways. One trick is to tell 'em stories that don't go anywhere. (pensioners agree) Like the time I caught the ferry over to Shelbyville. I needed a new heel for my shoe, so, I decided to go to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days. So I tied an onion to my belt, which was the style at the time. Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. "Give me five bees for a quarter," you'd say. Now where were we? Oh yeah - the important thing was that I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. (Burns and Smithers sigh) They didn't have white onions because of the war. The only thing you could get was those big yellow ones...

Burns then gets ready to hose down the strikers.

BURNS
Full power, Smithers!

However, the hose is held under his arm and the water can't get through. The pressure builds up and Burns goes flying. Lisa concludes her song.

LISA
So we'll march day and night, by the big cooling tower,
They have the plant, but we have the power.

LENNY
Now do Classical Gas.

She plays it. Burns watches Homer visiting the snack cart.

BURNS
Look at him, strutting around like he's cock of the walk. Well let me tell you, Homer Simpson is cock of nothing! You and I can run this plant ourselves.

So they do, all smiles and dancing. However, they get some robot workers (100% Loyal) which turns on them.

ROBOTS
Crush! Kill! Destroy!

Kent Brockman presents Smartline.

KENT
Tonight, on Smartline, the power plant strike: argle bargle, or fooforaw? With us tonight are plant owner C.M. Burns, union kingpin Homer Simpson, and talk show mainstay, Dr. Joyce Brothers.

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS
I brought my own mike!

KENT
Yes, well... Homer, organized labor has been called "a lumbering dinosaur".

HOMER
Aah!!

KENT
My director is telling me not to talk to you any more.

HOMER
Woohoo!

KENT
Uh, Mr. Burns, you mentioned you wanted an opening tirade.

BURNS
Yes, thank you, Kent. Fifteen minutes from now, I will wreak a terrible vengeance on this city. (threatening) No one will be spared! NO ONE!!!

KENT
(chuckling) A thrilling vision of things to come.

Burns and Smithers march down the corridors of the plant, past numerous security measures, eventually leading to a hidden control room, where the back door is open and off it's hinges.

BURNS
Oh, for God's sake! (slams door shut) Good bye, Springfield. From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!

He presses a button on the control panel in front of him. The power is Springfield goes out. Everyone immediately starts looting. An electric sign shows a marquee saying "Total Blackout In Springfield." The lights outside the power plant go out. The strikers pause, then Lisa starts playing the guitar again, and everyone gathers in a circle, singing.

STRIKERS
So we'll march day and night, by the big cooling tower,
They have the plant, but we have the power.
So we'll march day and night, by the big cooling tower,
They have the plant, but we have the power.

On his balcony, Burns listens.

BURNS
Look at them all, through the darkness I'm bringing. They're not sad at all. They're actually singing! (to Smithers) They sing without juicers. They sing without blenders. They sing without flunjers, capdabblers and smendlers! (groaning) Oh, tell Simpson I'm ready to deal.

Homer and Burns sit at a table.

BURNS
Alright, Simpson, you can have your dental plan, on one condition: you must resign as head of the union!

HOMER
Woohoo!

Homer walks in circles on the floor, saying "woob woob".

BURNS
Smithers, I'm beginning to think that Homer Simpson is not the brilliant tactician I thought he was.

Homer goes out to the strikers.

HOMER
We're goin' back to work!

ALL
Yay!

Electricity returns to Springfield. At Fake Vomit, inc. everyone cheers as the machines spring back into action. At the dentist, the whole family gather round Lisa.

MARGE
Oh, honey, you can hardly see your new braces.

LISA
And that's the tooth!

Everyone laughs.

DR. WOLFE
Whoops, I left the gas on.

Everyone laughs uproariously. Fade to credits.


#### SET 5 ####

ACT ONE
At Burns' mansion. The shots pans down past several signs on the gate: Keep Out, Danger Electrified Fence, Trespassers Will Be Shot, and Free Kittens - Inquire Within. Outside the front door, several guards march up and down, chanting.

GUARDS
All we own, we o-own, all we own, we o-own.

SMITHERS
(leaning out of a window) Shh!

GUARDS
(quieter) All we own, we o-own, all we own, we o-own...

Inside the mansion, Burns is in bed. We see his dream - a young Burns, playing with a stuffed bear.

BURNS
Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la! I'm the happiest boy there is, aren't I, Bobo?

A limousine pulls up, and the passenger talks to Burns' parents.

MOTHER
Happy! Come here, Happy!

BURNS
Yes, Mumsy?

FATHER
Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents, or would you rather live with this twisted, loveless billionaire?

Burns drops the bear, jumps into the limo, and puts sunglasses on.

BURNS
Let's roll!

FATHER
(calling after him) Wait! You forgot your bear, a symbol of your lost youth and innocence! Ah, oh well, at least we still have his little brother George.

GEORGE
(sings) Bwa bwa bwa bwa, Oh the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky Home, Bwa bwa bwa bwa... (spoken) Trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man.

The dream fades back to the present. Burns tosses and turns in his bed, holding a Nev-R-Break snow globe.

BURNS
I want my... teddy...

Smithers walks in as he drops the snow globe.

BURNS
Bobo... Bobo... (Smithers wakes him up) Huh? Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow.

SMITHERS
Who's Bobo, sir?

BURNS
Bobo? Uh, I... I... I meant Lobo! Uh, Sheriff Lobo, they never should have cancelled that show.

SMITHERS
I see. On another topic the preparations for your birthday have begun.

BURNS
I won't get what I really want.

SMITHERS
No one does...

Smithers imagines a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake, singing.

BURNS
Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers!

Smithers groans with pleasure. At the Simpsons home, Homer tosses in bed.

HOMER
Lobo... Lobo... Bring back Sheriff Lobo... Lobo... Lobo! (waking up with a jolt) Aaah!

MARGE
What is it?

Homer points to the calendar by the bed.

HOMER
Oh no! Burns' birthday!

MARGE
What's wrong?

HOMER
Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday, all the employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.

He recalls holding a piñata while a blindfolded Burns swings at it.

BURNS
Where is that dreaded piñata?

HOMER
(hit by Burns) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Missed me, heh heh! (hit) Ow.

Back to reality, and Marge has fallen back asleep.

Later that day at work, Homer is being played a prank on by his co-workers. They look on and laugh as Homer struggles to remove a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.

HOMER
Not funny! And the one in my pant really hurts!

Everyone laughs harder. Meanwhile, Burns watches him on the security monitors.

BURNS
That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers - who is he?

SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, sir, one of the carbon blobs from sector 7-G, but I don't think--

BURNS
I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.

SMITHERS
Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esque material.

Back at home, Homer writes his comedy act.

HOMER
(chuckling) Hee hee hee, I'm so funny. This is gonna be great!

MARGE
What are you doing?

HOMER
I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poopoo one word or two?

Homer & Bart laugh.

MARGE
I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.

LISA
Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns' foibles if done with the greatest of care could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.

HOMER
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. (chuckles) I paint a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants!

Bart laughs and gives Homer a high-five. Marge and Lisa groan.

It's Burns' birthday. Homer practices his comedy act in front of the mirror.

HOMER
Now, I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...

BART
Incontinent! (laughs) Too rich!

LISA
Does either of you know what incontinent means?

HOMER
Lisa, don't spoil our fun.

MARGE
Come on, everybody, it's time to go.

HOMER
Okay, stupid!

MARGE
Homer, you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss!

HOMER
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. (outside) Hey Flanders! You smell like manure!

FLANDERS
Uh oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose news, neighbor!

At the party, the guests enter. Former President George Bush is pulled aside by one of the guards.

GUARD
Hey! No one-termers.

Bush is pushed aside. Jimmy Carter has also been refused entry.

CARTER
You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place.

BUSH
Get away from me, loser.

Inside Burns' mansion. Smithers introduces the party.

SMITHERS
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Montgomery Burns: the life.

He shows some slides from Mr. Burns' life. A slide showing Burns with Bobo comes up.

BURNS
Oh, Bobo...

SMITHERS
Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones!

BURNS
Ah, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves.

RAMONE #1
I'd just like to say this gig sucks!

RAMONE #2
Hey, up yours, Springfield.

RAMONE #1
One, two, three, four! (loud guitar music begins) Happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #2
(backing) Happy birthday!

RAMONE #1
Happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #2
(backing) Happy birthday!

RAMONE #1
Happy birthday, Burnsie, happy birthday to you!

RAMONE #3
Go to hell, you old bastard!

The song finishes and the curtain closes.

RAMONE #4
Hey, I think they liked us.

BURNS
Have the Rolling Stones killed.

SMITHERS
But sir, those aren't the--

BURNS
Do as I say!

Burns opens his presents.

BURNS
Uh, stink, piffle... Dust Buster? Ugh...

Marge groans. Smithers brings a TV screen into view.

SMITHERS
Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There's a satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head slightly.

BURNS
Bah! No time! Next!

SMITHERS
I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie, was just run over in the parking lot. (audience gasp) And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!

Homer comes on stage.

HOMER
(loudly) Are you ready to laugh?

MAN
Poor dog.

HOMER
(loudly) I said, are you ready to laugh?

WOMAN
Quiet, you awful man!

HOMER
You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap!

BURNS
What?

HOMER
I mean, y'know, Mr. Burns is so old!

BURNS
How dare you!

HOMER
(to himself) Whoo, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. (to audience) Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find a little... cheeky!

He turns round, bends over and drops his pants to reveal a face painted on his butt. He wiggles his butt to the crowd.

HOMER
(mimicking) I'm Mr. Burns! Blah blah blah! I think I'm so big, blah blah blah! Do this, do that, blah blah blah!

BURNS
Destroy him.

Several guards approach him, wielding clubs.

HOMER
Bla bla bla-- (a guard hits him) Ow!

BURNS
This party is over!

A riot squad enters the room and causes chaos.

Back at the Simpsons' home. Homer has a lump on his head.

HOMER
Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.

LISA
I'd like to believe that this time, I really would.

MARGE
Bart, run down to the store and get a bag of ice for your father's head.

BART
Yes'm. (He turns to Homer) Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.

HOMER
Don't worry boy, she'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.

LISA
I knew it...

At Burns' mansion, Smithers tries to comfort Burns.

SMITHERS
Look at all the wonderful things you have, sir: King Arthur's Excalibur; the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain; and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word "suckers" in it.

BURNS
Yes yes yes, so what?

SMITHERS
You want your Bobo, don't you?

BURNS
Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! (He tries, but is too feeble.) Resistance is futile! (He falls into Smithers arms.) Oh God, how I want my bear. But he's gone, gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him.

The next few scenes follow Bobo's journey. The bear remains in the snow where it was dropped. When the snow melts, the bear is swept into the river. It is picked up in 1927 by a man who gives it to Charles Lindberg.

MAN
Why, put some grease in your garter, Lindy, you're late!

Lindberg flies off in a plane. He passes over Germany where a young Adolf Hitler catches Bobo as it falls. Later, in 1947, Hitler is in a bunker, while Germany is being bombed. He picks up the bear.

HITLER
This is all your fault!

He throws the bear outside. Next we see it in 1957, atop a submarine about to dive. Bobo becomes frozen in a block of ice, and is dug up in the Arctic in the present day. He is packed into a bag of ice, and put in a van. The van then arrives at the Kwik-E-Mart, and the men unload the bags of ice.

MAN
You've gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.

APU
If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it.

The men chatter, unable to think of one.

MAN
Beats me.

 Bart picks up a bag.

BART
Hey Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it.

APU
Ooh, a head bag! Those are choc-full of... heady goodness!

Bart opens the bag back at home and pulls out Bobo.

BART
Hey, it's a teddy bear. Ugh, gross, it's probably diseased or something. Here Maggie.

He gives the bear to Maggie. A close up of the bear shows a "100% COTTON" label, and then a label marked "Bobo".



ACT TWO
At Burns' mansion, Smithers enters wearing a bear costume.

SMITHERS
Here's something that should cheer you up, sir. It's me sir, Bobo! (He sits on Burns' lap) Hug me, squeeze me, tug at my fur!

BURNS
(pushes him off) Ugh, enough! Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my teddy! (as Smithers leaves) Oh and, er, leave the costume.

Kent Brockman delivers the news. Homer watches, while Maggie plays with Bobo in front of him.

KENT BROCKMAN
The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house... You could be looking at it right now. (Maggie holds up the bear) It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.

HOMER
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down. (he gasps) Moldy? Old? I'm gonna get something to eat!

Professor Frink has invented a robot bear for Mr. Burns.

FRINK
Well, it's not your original bear, of course, ng-hee, but it is programmed to be just as cuddly.

He turns it on using a remote control, but the bear seems to be evil. It grabs Burns.

FRINK
(messing with remote) Doggone it. It's supposed to be doing a little dance...

SMITHERS
I got it!

He smashes a chair over the bear's head.

FRINK
I'll try to turn it off...

BEAR
No, bear want to live! Aah!

The bear breaks through the wall to Burns' mansion.

While Lisa meditates to sea music in the living room, Maggie places the bear behind the fish tank. Bart knocks over a lamp which shines eerily onto the tank. At the top of the stairs, Homer trips on Bart's skateboard and falls down the stairs, hitting his head several times on the way down.

HOMER
Ah! D'oh! Ow! Son of a... D'oh! Stupid... stair!

 Upon reaching the bottom, he notices the fish tank.

HOMER
(gasp) How long have we had these fish? (gasp) Wait, it's a bear... Burns' bear!

The family sit round the kitchen table with the bear. Lisa checks the label.

LISA
Bobo. It's Mr. Burns' bear all right.

HOMER
Well Burns isn't getting this back cheap. He's gonna have to give me... my own recording studio.

He imagines himself singing with a brass ensemble.

HOMER
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun... (starts to drool) oh...

TECHNICIAN
Homer, you're drooling on the mike again.

Back to reality, and Homer is still drooling.

LISA
I think we should just give him the bear he cherishes so much.

Homer and Bart burst out laughing. Marge inspects the bear.

MARGE
Hmm... better sew that eye back on.

BART
No, let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear's in danger.

HOMER
(in a trance) Yes, we'll send the eye.

MARGE
I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. (pause) And then we'll make him double it!

FAMILY
Huh?

MARGE
Well why can't I be greedy once in a while?

Homer takes the bear to Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Bobo, my beautiful Bobo. I promise I'll never leave you behind again. (Homer coughs) Ah, yes. Er, naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because I'm strapped for cash.

The ceiling collapses, covering him in gold coins and jewels.

BURNS
As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But, I'm sure we can come to an understanding.

HOMER
Yes, sir. (pan up to his brain) Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.

BURNS
May I offer you a drink?

HOMER
Sorry, Burns, no deal!

Homer takes the bear and leaves.

BURNS
Don't worry Smithers. He's playing hardball now, but it won't take him long to crack.

Homer is sat at home. A cracking noise is heard, and Homer lunges for the phone.

HOMER
I gotta call Burns, I gotta call Burns! Maybe I can still get that drink!

BART
(putting the phone down) Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay.

HOMER
Right, that makes sense.

He suddenly dives onto the phone and tries to dial, but the whole family, including the pets, pull him back. A knock is heard at the door. Homer answers with the family still holding onto him. It's Burns.

HOMER
I knew you'd come crawling back.

BURNS
(inside) How much do you want?

HOMER
A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands. Good ones, not the leper one.

BURNS
Done! Now give me that bear!

HOMER
Woohoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya! Here you go!

Homer tries to pick up the bear, but Maggie is holding onto it.

HOMER
(struggling) It seems to be caught on something... Bad baby! Bad Maggie!

He finally wrestles it out of Maggie grasp, but she starts crying. Homer is unsure what to do.

BURNS
Give me the bear!

SMITHERS
The bear! The bear!

Homer gives the bear back to Maggie.

HOMER
Here you go, Maggie. The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.

BURNS
You've made a mistake, Simpson!

Smithers growls as they both leave.

HOMER
Big deal! Who needs his money? We're getting along fine.

Suddenly, Abe crashes a car through the wall of the Simpsons' home.

ABE
Son, you gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance! (pause) So, how's my Ute?



ACT THREE
It is night-time. Burns and Smithers stand atop Flanders' roof, dressed in black. Smithers shoots an arrow attached to a wire onto the Simpsons' roof.

BURNS
Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time.

Flanders pops his head out of the attic window.

FLANDERS
Howdy, gents, what can I diddily-do ya for?

Burns sprays something in his face, and he faints.

BURNS
Remember Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds.

They slide down the wire, but get stuck in the middle. They stay there until morning when the firemen rescue them. Burns is sitting in an ambulance, wrapped in a blanket.

MARGE
More cocoa, Mr. Burns?

BURNS
Yes.

The next night. Burns and Smithers get into the house, and crawl along the ceiling using suction pads. They are halfway across the kitchen when Homer, half asleep and in his underwear, enters and takes some cheese out of the fridge. He sits down at the table.

HOMER
Mmm... sixty four slices of American cheese. (starts eating them) Sixty four... sixty three...

Fade to morning, and he is struggling to finish.

HOMER
Two... One...

MARGE
(entering) Homer, have you been up all night eating cheese?

HOMER
I think I'm blind.

Burns and Smithers lose suction in their pads and fall to the floor. They get up quickly and brush themselves off.

HOMER
Wha?

BURNS
Good day to you. (exit)

At work the next day, fellow workmates gather round him.

MAN 1
Excuse me, we wanted to see the geek who valued the happiness of his children more than money.

HOMER
(bored) Right here.

MAN 2
Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.

HOMER
Oh, my life can't get any worse.

SMITHERS
(over the tannoy) Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties.

HOMER
D'oh!

Homer's "much worse" duty consists of him walking in a circle in the basement, turning a large gear, while being whipped by an executioner.

HOMER
(whip) Ow! (whip) D'oh! After lunch, can I whip you?

EXECUTIONER
No.

HOMER
Oh, no fair. (whip) Ow!

The view pans up a long way to the cafeteria, where Homer's efforts simply rotate a display of cakes. Lenny and Carl pass by.

LENNY
Mmm, I wonder what makes it turn.

CARL
Who cares?

Back at home again. Homer tries to coax the bear away from Maggie.

HOMER
Maggie, I know you like the bear, but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... (looks around, and picks up a cardboard box) this box! (plays with it) See Maggie? See the fun box? Do-do-do-do-do-do!

Maggie reaches for the box.

HOMER
No! My box! My box!

He runs to the other side of the room and plays by himself. Later in the bedroom, Marge enters from the en suite, her hair in a mess.

MARGE
Mmm, I think we need a new hairdryer.

HOMER
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.

MARGE
I don't hate you, I'm proud of you! You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.

HOMER
Aw, thanks Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured sole. (he picks up his box) Hee boxy!

MARGE
(snatching the box) Gimme that!

HOMER
Aw...

Homer watches Barney the Dinosaur on TV.

BARNEY
Two plus two is four, two plus two is four, two plus two is four...

HOMER
(chuckling) I can see why this show is so popular. Look at him. Heh.

Suddenly, the program is cut off and Mr. Burns appears on screen.

BURNS
Give me my bear, Simpson!

HOMER
Aah!

He changes channels.

TV PRESENTER
It's the sooooouuuul mass transit system!

Burns rushes on screen, panting.

BURNS
(out of breath) Give it to me!

Homer changes channel again. This time the Spanish Bee is playing with an oversized yoyo.

SPANISH BEE
Ay, el yoyo is grande!

Burns runs on screen and pushes the bee out of the way.

SPANISH BEE
Ay, chihuahua!

BURNS
As you can see, Simpson, I have taken over all 78 channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in.

OTTO
(driving the bus and watching TV) Whoa, that bites.

PATTY
(gasp) Holy crap!

BURNS
What's that you say? You can live without television so long as you have beer?

HOMER
That's right.

BURNS
Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer-swilling tube-jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson. (laughs evilly)

The doorbell then rings. It is Barney. He points a gun at Homer.

BARNEY
Homer, give him what he wants!

HOMER
Oh Barney, leave me alone!

He slams the door in Barney's face.

BARNEY
Whoops!

He is heard falling backwards. A shot is fired, smashing glass is heard, then a woman screaming, then a police siren.

BARNEY
Uh-oh.

Bart is at school, surrounded by bullies.

NELSON
My old man can't get a beer because his old man won't give a bear to another old man. Let's get him!

JIMBO
Wait! Why are we gettin' him?

MARTIN
(coming into the shot) Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season!

NELSON
Never mind. Let's just get him!

JIMBO
Yeah!

They chase after Martin, knocking Bart over as they run.

A sitcom starring Burns and Smithers is on TV. Burns enters a house

BURNS
Smithers, I'm home! (canned laughter)

SMITHERS
What, already? (more laughter)

BURNS
Yes! (louder laughing)

LISA
Is it my imagination, or is TV getting worse.

HOMER
Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out Smithers!

The sound of smashing glass can be heard, along with more canned laughter. Homer laughs.

HOMER
Heh heh. I love this show.

An angry mob appear outside the Simpsons' front window.

HOMER
Well, well, look who's come to apologize.

MOE
(outside) Come on, let's go in there and get the bear!

The crowd cheers and storms the house.

MOE
Ha! Got it!

 Moe takes Bobo from Maggie and it is passed towards the door. The mob starts to leave, but see Maggie crying.

MOE
Aw jeez, would you look at that.

JASPER
What have we become?

DR. HIBBERT
We've given the word "mob" a bad name.

They pass the bear back, and go outside.

MOE
Well, what should we do now?

SKINNER
Hey everyone! Let's go sing at the hospital!

The crowd cheers and walks off, singing.

CROWD
For we've got high hopes,
We've got high hopes...

Later. The doorbell rings. It is Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Simpson, look what you've reduced me to.

He clicks his fingers, and Smithers enters on his knees, begging.

SMITHERS
Please! Please!

HOMER
But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear, it's Maggie's.

Burns goes to the back garden, where Maggie is playing in the sandpit. Maggie instinctively grabs Bobo.

BURNS
So, good sand today, hmm? (Maggie offers him her pacifier) Oh, well, I don't usually, but...

As he puts it in his mouth, a photographer appears on the other side of the fence and takes a photo.

BURNS
Damn you paparazzo! (He throws the pacifier down.) Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement--

He suddenly lunges for the bear, but is too weak to take it from Maggie.

BURNS
Beaten by an infant... what could be more humiliating?

PHOTOGRAPHER
(takes a photo) What a scoop!

BURNS
Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang onto that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made.

He sighs, then gets up and walks away. He doesn't get very far when Maggie offers him Bobo back.

BURNS
For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened, I'm actually happy. Take a note! From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.

SMITHERS
I'm sorry sir, I don't have a pencil.

BURNS
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.

The family watch Burns and Smithers walk off.

HOMER
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?

MARGE
It's an ending, that's enough.

Smithers tucks Mr. Burns into bed.

SMITHERS
There you go.

BURNS
Ah, Bobo, reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. (yawning) Ah yes, wonder...

He falls asleep. In his dream, the year is 1,000,000 A.D., and apes are using several Homers as slaves, whipping them as they pull carts.

HOMER SLAVES
D'oh! D'oh!

Some apes dig up a pile of rocks, under which is Bobo. A robotic arm takes the bear, which is revealed to be Mr. Burns' head in a jar, with a robot body.

BURNS ROBOT
Bobo, I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again.

He runs off into the distance, and is followed by Smithers as a robot dog.

SMITHERS ROBOT
Wait for me, sir! Woof!

Fade to credits.



#### SET 6 #####
ACT ONE
The title sequence is as usual for Halloween episodes. We sweep through Springfield Cemetery and see more amusing tombstones, then cut to a special Halloween couch gag. The rest of the credits roll, in dripping green letters.

Bart wanders through an art gallery, with many scary paintings of the Simpsons family behind him.

BART
Paintings: lifeless images rendered in colorful goop. But at night, they take on a life of their own. They become portals to hell, so scary and horrible and gruesome that--

MARGE
Bart! You should warn people this episode is very frightening. And maybe they'd rather listen to that old "War of the Worlds" broadcast on NPR, hmm?

BART
Yes, mother.

MARGE
Good. Now you hold Maggie. I'm going to buy some earrings at the gift shop.

Marge gives Maggie to Bart, who sighs.

BART
The subject of our first painting tonight is the most foul, evil, vicious, diabolical beast to stalk the earth. Of course I refer to--

Maggie puts her pacifier in Bart's mouth.

BART
Mm-mm-mmm! (spits it out, coughing and spluttering) The devil...

The title "The Devil and Homer Simpson" appears in front of the painting. The story starts on a catwalk. Homer is in the crowd.

ANNOUNCER
The next in our fall catalogue, we love this, it is a vision in raspberry cream.

We see a model's legs walking down the catwalk, then a pan up to see a donut on top of the legs.

HOMER
Ooh, pure genius!

The scene fades to Homer dozing in the snack room. He wakes up with a start.

HOMER
And now to make the leap from dreams to reality!

He opens a box of donuts, but it is empty. Lenny and Carl stand behind him.

LENNY
Sorry Homer, while you were daydreaming we ate all the donuts.

CARL
Well, there were a few left, but we chucked them at an old man for kicks.

Outside the plant, Grampa has a donut stuck to the back of his head, and fights off some birds.

ABE
Damn buzzards! I ain't dead yet!

Homer returns to his workstation.

HOMER
Alright, stay calm. Remember your training.

He opens an "Emergency Procedures" manual. Inside, there is a big space with a piece of paper is in it. Homer reads it.

HOMER
"Dear Homer, I owe you one emergency donut. Signed, Homer." Bastard! He's always one step ahead. Oh... I'd sell my sould for a donut!

Suddenly, Flanders appears behind Homer, dressed like the devil.

FLANDERS
Well, that can be arranged.

HOMER
Flanders! You're the devil!?

FLANDERS
Ho ho, it's always the one you least suspect. Now, many people offer to sell their souls without reflecting upon the grave ramifications--

HOMER
Do you have a donut or not?

FLANDERS
Coming up! Just sign here. Careful, hot pen!

While Homer signs, Mr. Burns watches on the security monitors.

BURNS
Hmm, who is that goat-legged fellow? I like the cut of his jip.

SMITHERS
The Prince of Darkness, sir. He's your eleven o'clock.

Cut back to Homer and the devil. A creature appears, carrying a donut for Homer. Homer starts scoffing it.

FLANDERS
Now remember, the instant you finish it, I own your soul for--

HOMER
(with his mouth full) Hey wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?

FLANDERS
Uh, technically no, but--

HOMER
(taunting) I'm smarter than the devil! I'm smarter than the devil!

Suddenly, Flanders turns into a huge scary monster.

SCARY DEVIL
You are not smarter than me! I'll see you in Hell yet, Homer Simpson!

He disappears back into the ground. Homer puts the donut in his shirt pocket.

HOMER
Not likely, heh heh.

Later that night, Homer comes down stairs for a midnight snack. Looking in the fridge, his hand passes over several food items, and he picks up the last piece of the donut, despite several warning signs around it.

HOMER
Mmm... forbidden donut...

He eats it, and Flanders appears again.

FLANDERS
Well, well, finishing something?

HOMER
Aah!

A hole of fire appears in the kitchen floor and Homer is dragged towards it. Marge enters the room and her night cap is drawn into the hole.

MARGE
Homer, did you eat that donut?

HOMER
(weakly) No.

Homer is drawn into the hole, but gets stuck.

FLANDERS
Oh, your wide behind won't save you this time! (Bart & Lisa enter) Hey Bart.

BART
Hey.

LISA
Wait! Doesn't my father have the right to a fair trial?

FLANDERS
Oh, you Americans with your "due process" and "fair trials." This is always so much easier in Mexico. Very well, we'll have the trial tomorrow at the stroke of midnight. Until then, you're going to spend the day in Hell!

His pitchfork turns into a plunger. He pushes Homer into the hole, and follows him. Homer falls through a huge cavern, screaming all the way into Hell. He lands on a conveyor belt.

HOMER
Ah, that wasn't so bad.

He reaches the end of the conveyor belt, where a demon chops him in to pieces. His mouth and shoes are separated and put into a bin labeled "Hot Dog Meat." Next, Homer is in a room labeled "Ironic Punsihemnts Division." Another demon straps Homer into a chair. The room is full of donuts.

DEMON
So, you like donuts, eh?

HOMER
Uh-huh.

DEMON
Well, have all the donuts it the world!

The demon laughs. A machine feeds donuts to Homer, four at a time. Homer keeps eating and eating, and eating. Later, Homer has eaten most of the donuts, and is extremely fat.

HOMER
More.

DEMON
I don't understand it. James Coco went mad in fifteen minutes!

The clock in the Simpsons' living room strikes midnight. Flanders appears, as does Homer's body appears in a cage made of fire. His head appears shortly afterwards, and Homer screws it back onto his neck.

MARGE
Homer! Are you alright?

HOMER
No.

Lionel Hutz walks in, combing his hair with a fork.

HUTZ
Mr. Simpson, don't you worry. I watched Matlock in a bar last night. The sound wasn't on, but I think I got the gist of it.

A fiery pentagram appears on the floor. The Grim Reaper appears as the judge.

GRIM REAPER
Hear ye, hear ye. The Court of Infernal Affairs is now in session.

HUTZ
Very well, but first some ground rules. Number one, we get bathroom breaks every half-hour.

FLANDERS
Agreed. Number two, the jury will be chosen by me.

HUTZ
Agreed. (realizing) No, wait--

FLANDERS
Silence! I give you the Jury of the Damned! Benedict Arnold, Lizzie Borden, Richard Nixon...

NIXON
But I'm not dead yet! In fact, I just wrote an article for Redbook.

FLANDERS
Hey, listen: I did a favor for you!

NIXON
Yes, master.

FLANDERS
...John Wilkes Booth, Blackbeard the Pirate, John Dillinger, and the starting line of the 1976 Philadelphia Flyers!

There doesn't seem to be enough seats for everyone. Marge brings out a high chair for Blackbeard the Pirate.

MARGE
I'm sorry, Mr. Blackbeard. We're low on chairs, and this is the last one.

BLACKBEARD
Arr! This chair be high, says I.

The proceedings begin.

FLANDERS
I hold here a contract between myself and one Homer Simpson pledging me his soul for a donut -- which I delivered! And it was scrump-diddly-umptious! I simply ask for what is mine!

The jury chatter.

HUTZ
That was a right-pretty speech, sir. But I ask you, what is a contract? Webster's defines it as "an agreement under the law which is unbreakable." (with emphasis) Which is unbreakable! (the jury stare at him) Excuse me, I must use the restroom.

A long time goes by and Hutz has not come out. Marge goes to see.

MARGE
Uh, Mr. Hutz?

She opens the door. He is not there, and the window is open. The Grim Reaper starts the sentencing.

GRIM REAPER
Homer Simpson, I have no choice but to sentence you to an eternity of--

MARGE
Wait! Before you send him to Hell, there's something you should see. (shows the jury a photo) That's a photo of homer and me at our wedding.

NIXON
Wait, wait, you got married in an emergency room?

MARGE
Well, Homer ate the entire wedding cake by himself... before the wedding! (The jury laugh) Read the back! The back!

BLACKBEARD
Arr, 'tis some kind of treasure map!

ARNOLD
(snatching photo) You idiot, you can't read!

BLACKBEARD
Aye, 'tis true. My debauchery was my way of compensating!

ARNOLD
Dear Marge: you have given me your hand in marriage. All I can give you in return is my... soul, which I pledge to you forever.

The jury debate amongst themselves.

LIZZIE
We've heard enough. Your Honor, we find that Homer Simpson's soul is legally the property of Marge Simpson and not of the devil.

FLANDERS
Oh...

FAMILY
Yay!

HOMER
Woohoo! (jumps and burns his head on the cage) Ow!

The judge and jury disappear in a puff.

FLANDERS
All right, Simpson. you get you soul back. But let that ill-gotten donut be forever on your head!

He points and fire shoots out. Homer screams. The next at breakfast, Homer picks chunks off his donut-head and eats them.

MARGE
Homer, stop picking at it.

HOMER
Oh, but I'm so sweet and tasty! (looks at his watch) Oh, well, time to go to work.

LISA
Dad, I wouldn't go outside if I were you.

Outside, the whole police force wait, with cups of coffee.

WIGGUM
Don't worry boys, he's gotta come out of there sometime.



ACT TWO
Back in the gallery, Bart narrates the second spooky story.

BART
The next exhibit in out ghoulish gallery is entitled... "The School Bus"? Oh, oh, they must mean "The Ghoul Bus."

LISA
Nope, says right there: "School Bus".

BART
Well, there's nothing scarier than having to go to school! Ha ha!

He groans and walks off. The title, "Terror at 5½ Feet" appears on screen, and the painting of the school bus comes to life. Bart sits next to Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Hey Bart, look. Krusty trading cards. The long-awaited eighth series.

BART
(reads the cards) "Krusty visits relatives in Annapolis, Maryland. Krusty poses for trading card photo."

MILHOUSE
Hmm... he seems to be running a little low on ideas.

BART
Well, at least you got the gum.

MILHOUSE
(bites it) Ow! I cut my cheek!

Suddenly, one of the back wheels comes off the bus and it loses control. It steers right into the path of an oncoming lorry. As the bus hits the lorry, Bart wakes up, screaming. He feels his damp blankets.

BART
I hope this is sweat.

He walks into the kitchen for breakfast.

LISA
Bart, what's wrong?

BART
(in a trance) I just had a vision of my own horrible fiery death.

LISA
And?

MARGE
Lisa, your brother's obviously had a nightmare. Don't worry, honey, the scary part's over.

Suddenly, a loud horn sounds and Bart screams. It is Homer with an air horn.

HOMER
Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina. It was just sitting in some guy's boat!

He honks the horn again. Bart screams and falls backwards off his chair. Later that morning, the kids get on the bus for school. Bart sees Skinner sitting on the bus.

SKINNER
Hello, Simpson. I'm riding the bus today because Mother hid my car keys to punish me for talking to a woman on the phone. She was right to do it.

LISA
Excuse me. Bart's a little upset this morning, so could everyone please be extra-nice to him?

Everyone laughs. Jimbo pulls down Bart's pants.

JIMBO
Hey, where's your diaper, baby?

MARTIN
(wearing a shirt saying "Wang Computers") Thank goodness he's drawn attention away from my shirt.

Bart sits next to Milhouse. He looks out the window and sees a gremlin on the side of the bus. It makes a deep scratch in the side of the bus.

BART
Milhouse, Milhouse, wake up, quick! Look out the window.

MILHOUSE
No way, Bart. If I lean over, I leave myself open to wedgies, wet willies, or even the dreaded rear-admiral!

Bart rushes to the front of the bus.

BART
Otto, you gotta do something! There's a gremlin on the side of the bus!

Otto looks out the window and sees Hans Moleman driving an AMC Gremlin.

OTTO
Eh, no problemo Bart, I'll get rid of him.

Otto rams into the side of Hans' car, and he rolls off the road.

HANS
Oh no, I just made my last payment.

His car stops just before hitting a tree. It then explodes. Bart looks out the window again, and the gremlin is still there. It starts pulling wires out from inside the bus.

BART
Aah! Everybody, there's a monster on the side of the bus!

Everyone screams and runs over to look.

JIMBO
Hey, there's no monster.

RALPH
You're deceptive.

OTTO
I don't see anything.

MILHOUSE
Hey! Who's driving the bus?

OTTO
Ooh, una momento, por favor.

As the bus continues to roll along, Kang & Kodos watch from their space ship.

KANG
Foolish Earthling! Frightened of a creature that does not exist!

They both laugh continuously, then notice a gremlin on the side of their spaceship. Back on the bus, Skinner comes to see Bart.

SKINNER
Now I've gotten word that a child is using his imagination, and I've come to put a stop to it.

BART
No, no, it's true, there's a monster on the bus!

SKINNER
The only monster on this bus is a lack of proper respect for the rules.

He pulls down the window shade so Bart cannot see out of the window. Bart is still nervous. Eventually, he lifts the blind up again, to see Groundskeeper Willy staring back at him. Bart screams again. The bus has stopped, and Willy gets on.

WILLY
Me mule wouldn't walk in the mud. So I had to put seventeen bullets in 'im!

BART
(becoming frightened) You believe me, don't you? You're my friend who believes me: sweet, trustworthy Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Actually, Bart, you're kinda creeping me out. Uh, I think I'm gonna go sit... uh, with that foreign exchange student! (points to Uter)

UTER
Ah, guten tag! Would you care for a bite of my Vengelerstrasse bar? I also have a bag of marzipan JoyJoys.

The bag says "JoyJoys mit Iodine". Bart looks out of the window again. The gremlin starts taking off the wheel.

BART
The gremlin's taking off the wheel. Stop the bus or we're all gonna die!

Skinner grabs him, pinning him down.

WILLY
Take me bridle and lash his hands to the seat.

It is a few moments later, and Uter is sat next to Bart.

UTER
Would you like another lick of my flavor wax?

BART
(does so, then shudders) Well, now that we're friends, Uter, how about loosening these straps, huh?

UTER
Ja, das ist gut.

Bart looks out the window again to see the gremlin is still removing nuts from the wheel. He looks below his seat and sees a box of flares, but they have been removed - Jimbo has lit them and put them into Martin's pants. Bart takes one, then opens the window, however, he is pulled through. Skinner and Willy grab his legs as Bart waves the flare around at the gremlin. Just then Homer drives past with his air horn.

HOMER
Hey boy! (honks horn)

Skinner and Willy try to pull Bart back inside the bus.

SKINNER
Pull, Willy, pull!

WILLY
I'm doing all the pulling, you blouse-wearing poodle walker!

Just as they pull Bart inside, he drops the flare onto the gremlin, who catches fire and falls off the back of the bus, bouncing along. It hits Flanders' windscreen, and he screeches to a halt.

NED
Oh dear Lord! It's some sort of hideous monster. (wraps it up in his jacket, and it claws at him) Aw, isn't that cute, he's trying to claw my eyes out!

The bus arrives at Springfield Elementary, where is falls apart.

SKINNER
Gadzooks!

Bart is being pulled away on a stretcher wearing a straight jacket.

BART
Look at the bus! I was right, I tell you, I was right!

SKINNER
Right or wrong, your behavior was still disruptive, young man! Perhaps spending the remainder of your life in a madhouse will teach you some manners.

NELSON
Ha ha!

Bart is taken away in an ambulance to "New Bedlam Mental Hospital".

BART
Ah. At least now I can get some rest.

However, the gremlin appears at the back window, holding Flanders' severed head.

NED
Hi-dilly-ho, Bart!

Bart screams one last time.



ACT THREE
Back in the gallery once again.

BART
We come now to the final and most terrifying painting of the evening. To even gaze upon it is to go mad.

He points to a picture of dogs playing poker. Homer is looking at it.

HOMER
Aah! They're dogs... and they're playing poker! (screams and runs off)

BART
We had a story to go with this painting, but it was far too intense. So we just threw something together with vampires. Enjoy!

Kent Brockman delivers the news.

KENT
Another local peasant has been found dead. Drained of his blood with two teeth marks on his throat. This black cape was found on the scene. (we see a picture of a cape reading "Dracula") Police are baffled.

WIGGUM
We think we're dealing with a supernatural being, most likely a mummy. As a precaution I've ordered the Egyptian wing of the Springfield museum destroyed. (we see Eddie throwing the Mona Lisa into a fire) Nice work, Eddie.

LISA
They're wrong! The creature they seek is the walking undead: Nosferatu, Das Wampyr! (family stare blankly) A vampire!

HOMER
(chuckling) Lisa, Vampires are make-believe, just like Elves, Gremlins and Eskimos.

Back to the TV.

KENT
In a completely unrelated story, Montgomery Burns has just closed a deal to buy the Springfield blood bank.

BURNS
Oh, I'm very excited about this deal. (sees blood dripping from his mouth and licks it) Mmm... precious blood.

HOMER
Hmm... business deal.

The family drives along a twisty mountain road.

HOMER
It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for midnight dinner in his country house in... (creepily) Pennsylvania!

LISA
Ah, there's something fishy about this whole set-up.

MARGE
Lisa, stop been so suspicious. Now did everyone wash their necks like Mr. Burns asked?

LISA
(moaning) Yes...

HOMER
(pulling out a filthy cloth) Sure did!

The family arrive at the mansion. Homer rings the doorbell. Burns voice is heard on the speaker.

BURNS
Welcome, come in. (quietly) Ah, fresh victims for my ever growing army of the undead.

SMITHERS
Sir, you have to let go of the button.

BURNS
Oh, son of a bi--

The doors open and the Simpsons walk in. Burns suddenly appears, with Smithers behind him.

BURNS
Well if it isn't my good friends the, uh...

SMITHERS
Simpson family, master.

BURNS
Simpson, eh? Excellent.

Burns walks off, but his shadow plays with a yo-yo.

LISA
Dad, do you notice anything strange?

HOMER
Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.

BURNS
I heard that!

HOMER
It was the boy!

At the dinner table.

HOMER
Ooh, punch!

LISA
Ew, Dad, this is blood!

HOMER
Correction: free blood!

Lisa spills her blood deliberately.

LISA
Whoops! Bart and I have to go wash up.

BART
But you didn't get any on-- (Lisa smears him with blood) --ew!

They both leave, and walk down a corridor.

BART
Burns isn't a vampire. And even if he was we're not going to stubble on his secret hiding place.

Bart leans on a lamp attached to the wall, which causes a wall to move. It reveals a laundry room.

LISA
You're probably right, let's just go back to--

She gasps as she sees a neon sign reading "Secret vampire room, no garlic." They both go down some steps into the room. There are several coffins lying about.

LISA
Satisfied?

BART
Big deal! It's no different from the basement in Grandpa's rest home.

LISA
Look!

She finds a book titled "Yes, I Am A Vampire" by Mr. Burns.

LISA
(reading) Oh My God!

Vampires rise up from the coffins.

BART
Ungh, Ungh!

LISA
Please, Bart, I've seen your stupid shemp.

BART
Nub, Nub! Ba-ba-ba!

LISA
Yeah, I've seen your curly too.

A vampire rips the page. Lisa screams, and the kids run up the stairs screaming. Bart passes a switch reading "Super Fun Happy Slide."

BART
I know I really shouldn't, but when am I going to be here again? (pulls switch and slides) Wheeeee! Aah!

He slides down into the clutches of the vampires. A bat flies in, morphing into Burns.

BURNS
Well if it isn't little... boy!

Burns' fangs extend and he dives for Bart. Meanwhile, Lisa runs back to the dining room to tell her parents.

LISA
Mom, Dad! Mr. Burns is a vampire and he has Bart!

BURNS
(in the doorway with blood on his fangs) Why, Bart is right here.

BART
(in a trance) Hello, Mother, hello, Father. I missed you during my uneventful absence.

HOMER
Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire. Beer kills brain cells. Now lets go back to that building... thingy... where our beds and TV... is.

In Lisa's bedroom, she hears banging on her window. She opens to curtains to find Bart, Milhouse, Martin, Ralph and Janey all vampires.

LISA
Aah!

BART
Come join us Lisa, it's so cool, you get to stay up all night drinking blood!

MILHOUSE
And if you say you're a vampire, they give you a free small soda at the movies.

LISA
No, no!

BART
Lisa, it's not like you have a choice here!

We see Bart smash the window from several different angles. He grabs Lisa and his fangs extend. Lisa screams and Homer runs in.

HOMER
Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sis-- (realizes) wait a minute, you are a vampire!

Grampa runs in with a stake and hammer.

GRAMPA
Quick, we have to kill the boy!

MARGE
(entering) How do you know he's a vampire?

GRAMPA
He's a vampire? Aah!

He runs off, screaming. Bart turns to a bat and escapes, chuckling.

MARGE
Homer, we have to do something. Today he's drinking blood, tomorrow he could be smoking!

LISA
The only way to get Bart back is to kill the head vampire. Mr. Burns!

HOMER
Kill my boss?! Do I dare live out the American dream?

At Burns' castle. Homer, Marge and Lisa walk down to the basement.

MARGE
This is dangerous. I wish we could have found a sitter for Maggie.

HOMER
(sees sign for slide and gets excited) Super Fun Happy Slide!

LISA
(sternly) No dad.

HOMER
Oh, I guess killing will be fun enough.

LISA
You must drive this stake right through his heart.

Homer drives the stake into Burns.

HOMER
Take that, vile fiend!

LISA
Uh, Dad, that's his crotch.

HOMER
(chuckling) Oh, sorry.

He takes the stake out and drives it into his heart. Burns wakes up, screaming. He then dies and turns to goo.

HOMER
Whew!

BURNS
(reforming briefly) You're fired!

HOMER
D'oh!

The next day, at the Simpsons' breakfast table.

LISA
It's so nice having everything back to normal.

GRAMPA
(flying into the room) I'm a vampire and I've come to suck your blood! (he flies into the fridge and collapses) This cape is giving me a rash.

LISA
Grampa's a vampire?

BART
We're all vampires!

The family all start floating in mid-air.

LISA
But no, we killed Mr. Burns!

HOMER
You have to kill the head vampire!

LISA
You're the head vampire?

MARGE
No, I'm the head vampire! (she screeches)

LISA
Mom?

MARGE
Well I do have a life outside this house, you know.

The family all fly at Lisa, fangs extended. They stop and wave at the camera.

EVERYONE
Happy Halloween everybody!

They all start humming Christmas carols, accompanied by Milhouse on a tiny piano. Fade to credits.



#### SET 7 ####
ACT ONE
At the Kwik-E-Mart.

MAN 1
I need one twenty-nine-cent stamp.

APU
That's a dollar-eighty-five.

MAN 2
I'd like two dollars worth of gas, please.

APU
Four-twenty.

MARTIN
How much is your penny candy?

APU
Surprisingly expensive!

MARTIN
What a rip-off.

The customers all groan and leave. One man grabs something from a display.

MAN 1
This is what I think of your store!

He twists the product, throws it on the floor and walks out.

APU
Silly customer! You cannot hurt a Twinkie!

Apu picks it up and it pops back into shape. He puts it back, then notices a strange smell. On one shelf a packet of ham reads "Exp. Feb. 6, 1989". He smells the pack.

APU
Jiminy Cricket! Wooh, expired ham. (He crosses the date out and puts it on the "Bargain Table") Oh, this time I have gone to far. No, no one will fall for--

HOMER
(Walks into the store) Woohoo! Cheap meat! (picks it up) Ooh, this one's open.

He starts eating it. Later at home, Homer is on the couch, still finishing it off. His stomach starts to growl.

HOMER
Stomach...churning! (eats more) Bowels...clenching! Not much time... (falls off the couch) ...must...finish...

He finishes the ham. Cut to an ambulance rushing him to hospital.

DR. HIBBERT
(At hospital) Well sir, Homer's illness was either caused by ingesting spoiled food, or, (chuckling) some sort of voodoo curse.

PATTY
Hey, we've just been working the eyes.

She holds up a Homer doll with pins in the eyes. Later at the Kwik-E-Mart, Homer confronts Apu.

HOMER
Your old meat made me sick!

APU
Oh, I'm so sorry. (pulls out a bucket from under the counter) Please accept five pounds of frozen shrimp.

HOMER
(holds one up and sniffs it) This shrimp isn't frozen! And it smells funny!

APU
(brings out another bucket) Okay, ten pounds.

HOMER
Woohoo!

An ambulance rushed Homer to hospital again. Later at home, a television program shows a dog in detective uniform, barking. With each bark a word flies onto the screen. Together, it reads "Bite Back with Kent Brockman and his Channel 6 Consumer Watch Unit". Homer and Lisa are watching this show; Homer is lying ill on the couch and Lisa sitting on the floor.

TV VOICEOVER
Brought to you by... (more barking)

HOMER
That dog can sell anything.

BROCKMAN
(At news desk) Good evening. Here's an update on last week's nursing home exposé, "Geezers in Freezers". It turns out the rest home was adequately heated; the footage you saw was of a fur-storage facility. We've also been told to apologize for using the term "geezers". Now, coming up next, the case of the cantankerous old geezer.

HOMER
(stomach growls again) Oh, rancid meat attack! Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?

BROCKMAN
If you have a consumer complaint, just call this number--

HOMER
Boring!

LISA
Dad, you should blow the whistle on the Kwik-E-Mart.

BROCKMAN
And now a message from the Church of Latter-Day Saints. (the dog barks again)

LISA
Dad, are you listening to me?

HOMER
Shh! Lisa, the dog is barking.

Sometime later at Channel 6 Studios, Homer talks to Kent.

BROCKMAN
All right, are you willing to go undercover to nail this creep?

HOMER
No way, man. No way, man! Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire!

BROCKMAN
All right, all right, all right. Would you be willing to wear a hidden camera and microphone?

HOMER
Oh, that I'll wear.

The next day, a van labeled "Ordinary Van" is parked outside the Kwik-E-Mart. Homer and Kent are inside. Kent and another man hold up a large hat with an obviously visible camera inside.

BROCKMAN
We've come up with a camera so tiny, it fits into this oversized novelty hat.

They put it on Homer's head. He struggles to stand upright under the weight.

BROCKMAN
Now, go get us some incriminating footage, and remember: you have to get in and out in ten minutes, or you'll suffer permanent neck damage.

A man with his head bent sideways at right angles appears.

MAN
He's not kiddin'.

Homer enters the Kwik-E-Mart, unable to walk straight because of the hat. Apu looks confused as he slowly makes his way to the counter.

APU
Ooh?

HOMER
Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.

APU
Your headgear seems to be emitting a buzzing noise, sir. Perhaps you have a bee in your bonnet?

HOMER
Bee? Aah!

He throws the hat on the floor and screams, stomps on it and runs out of the store still screaming and into the van.

BROCKMAN
Homer, that hat's been with the station for twenty years! He had one day left till retirement.

The camera still seems to be working. On the monitor in the van, the crew see Apu going about his business.

APU
Well, time to replenish the hot dog roller. La, la, la...

He drops a hot dog, and it rolls right up to the camera. It's covered with dirt, a dead fly, and a bandage. Apu picks it up.

APU
Aw look, it is encrusted with filth. (blows some of the dirt off) Oh well, let's sell it anyway. (looks into the camera) Now this is just between me and you, smashed hat! (chuckles)

BROCKMAN
Hot diggety-dog, we've got him, Mr. Simpson! Now let's...Mr. Simpson?

They see him on the monitor inside the Kwik-E-Mart.

HOMER
One hot dog, please. (eats it)

The next day, the Simpsons family watch the "Bite Back" episode

BROCKMAN
Apu, will you ever stop selling spoiled meat?

APU
(nervously) No...I mean, yes...I mean...uh-oh...

Apu is also watching at the Kwik-E-Mart in front of some customers. He turns the TV off.

APU
I think I come off very well.

WOMAN
Monster! Run, children.

As they run out, an inspector and two men in suits come in.

INSPECTOR
Apu Nahasapeemapetilan, you have disgraced the Kwik-E-Mart Corporation.

APU
But, sir, I was only following standard procedure.

INSPECTOR
Ah, true. But it's also standard procedure to blame any problems on a scapegoat or sacrificial lamb.

APU
Uh huh, and if I can obtain for you these animals?

INSPECTOR
I'm sorry, Apu: I have no choice. You can no longer wear this name patch. (tears it off; Apu gasps) And you can no longer tell people about our fried pickles. (tears off another patch) Now, turn in your pricing gun.

Apu takes it out of a shoulder holster and hands it in.

INSPECTOR
The other one, too.

Apu takes it out if an ankle holster and gives it to the inspector.

APU
(sighs) Fired...after all these years of loyal service. I don't want to live any more! (picks up a hot dog and is about to eat it)

INSPECTOR
(grabs him) Give me that wiener!

APU
I don't want to live, sir!

INSPECTOR
Give me that wiener! (they struggle) No, Apu, it's not worth it!

That night, Apu stands on a bridge, depressed.

APU
What do I do now? I have been drummed out of my profession. I'm a disgrace! Even this babbling brook sounds almost like mocking laughter.

Two homeless guys are underneath the bridge, tickling each other with feathers.

HOBO
(laughing) Who needs money when we got feathers?

Apu walks past a pet store. A sign in the window reads "Today Only -- Laughing Monkeys." A bunch of monkeys all begin to laugh and point at him. Apu then wanders down the Simpsons' street and stops in front of their house. A thunderstorm begins.

APU
This is all because of Homer Simpson!

Inside, Homer is on the couch watching TV and laughing. He watches a black stand-up comedian.

HOMER
Oh, oh, stop!

COMEDIAN
Yo, check this out: black guys drive a car like this! (Leans back, as though one hand is on the wheel and his elbow is resting on the windowsill, and sings a tune) Do, do, chh. Do be do, do be do-be-do. (audience laughs) Yeah, but white guys, see, they drive a car like this! (Leans forward forward with both hands on the wheel) Dee-da-dee, a-dee-da-dee...

HOMER
(laughing hard) It's true, it's true! We're so lame!

APU
(outside the window) It is time to settle the score!

He knocks on the door and Homer opens it. Apu, drenched in rain water, threateningly reaches his arms out for Homer. Homer steps back and screams.



ACT TWO
Homer is still screaming.

HOMER
No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware. I was unaware! (sobs)

APU
Mr. Simpson, you misunderstand me. In my village, this is the traditional pose of apology.

HOMER
Oh.

APU
(putting his arms down) You know, now that I think about it, it may be a little confusing. Many have died needlessly. I have come to make amends, sir. At first, I blamed you for squealing, but then I realized, it was I who wronged you. So I have come to work off my debt - I am at your service.

HOMER
You're selling what, now?

APU
I am selling only the concept of karmic realignment.

HOMER
You can't sell that! Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos. (slams door)

APU
(to himself) He's got me there.

The next day, Marge and the kids see Apu raking leaves on the family's front lawn. Homer comes down the stairs.

HOMER
Is he still out there?

MARGE
Yes, he's raking leaves.

HOMER
What? That's your job! If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping--

MARGE
If he wants to make it up to you so badly I think you should let him.

HOMER
Okay, okay, I'll let him. But then I get a Chipwich, okay?

Later, Apu serves the family dinner.

APU
It is an honor to begin repaying my debt to you. Back in Ramatpur I was considered quite the gourmet.

MARGE
Hmm, it certainly is exotic. (sees Lisa panting with a vacant stare) Ooh, Lisa, is that too spicy for you?

LISA
I can see through time!

HOMER
(wolfing it down) Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a-- Apu, what do you call this thing again?

APU
A napkin.

HOMER
(laughing) Outrageous!

Meanwhile at the Kwik-E-Mart, the inspector and a woman are interviewing Barney.

INSPECTOR
All right, why do you want to become part of the Kwik-E-Mart family?

BARNEY
Because I like people. And I need a place where I'll be out of the sun.

WOMAN
Thank you.

Barney burps and leaves.

INSPECTOR
Hmm... he's head and shoulders above everyone else.

WOMAN
Hold on, there's one more applicant.

James Woods walk into the room and sits down.

INSPECTOR
Name?

WOODS
James Woods, heh.

WOMAN
Previous job experience?

WOODS
Ooh, uh, let's see...True Believer, Salvador, Onion Field, The Hard Way.

INSPECTOR
Wait, wait a minute. Those aren't convenience stores. That sounds more like the resume of a Hollywood movie star!

WOODS
(chuckles) Well, er...

INSPECTOR & WOMAN
(gasp) James Woods!

WOMAN
Why would you want to work at a Kwik-E-Mart?

WOODS
To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, I kind of like to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, True Believer? I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin, I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled in time, back to the twenties, where-- oh, heh, I've said too much.

INSPECTOR
Welcome aboard.

The next morning, Homer is taking a shower. He steps out of the cubicle and reaches for his towel, but can't find it. Apu hands the towel to Homer.

APU
Good morning, sir!

HOMER
Aah!

APU
Relax, please. You do not have anything I have not seen before. (looks down) What the--

Homer has a lollipop stuck to his chest.

HOMER
Uh... I like to keep a lollipop there.

In the kitchen, Apu stacks cans of corn in a pyramid.

MARGE
Hmm... Apu, we normally store out cans in the cupboard.

APU
Oh they'll never move that way.

Bart and Lisa enter and take a can each.

LISA
Mmm, corn. Haven't had that in a while.

BART
Yeah, delicious corn.

BART & LISA
Bye.

They leave. Marge looks in the fridge.

MARGE
Oh, we're low on milk for Maggie. You want to come with me to the Kwik-E-Mart?

Apu accidentally knocks over the stack of cans in shock.

APU
Please, Mrs. Simpson, I...I cannot go there. That is the scene of my spiritual de-pantsing.

MARGE
Hmm...well, I guess we could go to that new Monstromart.

The Monstromart is a huge concrete block. The store's motto reads "Where Shopping Is A Baffling Ordeal". Inside, the products are oversized, the aisles are wide, and the shelving reaches to the ceiling. Marge picks up a huge box of nutmeg.

MARGE
Ooh, that's a good price for twelve pounds of nutmeg.

APU
Oh, great selection at rock-bottom prices. But where is the love?

An announcement comes over the tannoy.

TANNOY
Attention, Monstromart shoppers. Just a reminder that we love each and every one of you.

CUSTOMERS
Ahh...

Barney pushes a flatbed trolley with a large keg of Duff Beer on it. He passes a display of pancake syrup bottles, shaped like people.

BARNEY
(approaching a bottle) Excuse me ma'am, where are the lampshades? (pushing the bottle on the 'shoulder') Ma'am? (he knocks the bottle over, spilling syrup) Oh no. I've killed her! It's all happening again!!

He screams and runs into a display of cranberry juice bottles, causing a tidal wave to wash down the aisle that Marge and Apu are in.

SHOP ASSISTANT
(drowning) Help me! Help m-- (he goes under, then resurfaces) Mmm, it's cran-tastic!

Marge and Apu arrive at the Express Lane, which is strictly "1000 Items Or Less".

APU
Look, Mrs. Simpson, the express line is the fastest line not always. That old man up front, he is staved for attention, he will talk the cashier's head off.

The old man is Grampa Simpson.

GRAMPA
Ah, there's an interesting story behind this nickel. In 1957 I remember it was. I got up in the morning and made myself a piece of toast. I set the toaster to three - medium brown.

APU
Let's cut to... that line.

MARGE
But that's the longest!

APU
Yes, but look: all pathetic single men. Only cash, no chit-chat.

They move through the line quickly. Marge sighs with satisfaction. At the Kwik-E-Mart, James Woods serves Jimbo.

WOODS
75, 85, 90, and a dollar. Thank you, and come again. (Jimbo starts to leave) Hey wait a minute! Hey! Uh, could I just ask you a question? Did you, heh, did you believe that, I mean, the way I gave you the change, that I sound like a real Kwik-E-Mart, you know, kinda guy?

JIMBO
Actually, I though it was a little laboured. You gotta lose yourself in the moment, man!

WOODS
Yeah, like yeah, okay great! Okay, let's just try that again. Okay, come on. (Jimbo starts to leave) Come on, hey, hey hey hey! Hey!! Get over here! (Jimbo comes back to the counter) Okay, now you're you, I'm me.

JIMBO
I'm me?

WOODS
(grabs Jimbo) Hey, don't jerk me around, fella.

Back at the Simpson home, the family eat dinner.

HOMER
Pass the chutney.

MARGE
Apu, you've been so helpful. If it weren't for him, we'd still be in line at the Monstromart.

LISA
And he taught me how to play the Shenai. (plays a weird wind instrument)

HOMER
(shudders) Oh, that's even worse than the album Grampa released.

BART
And he taught me how to do this. (he wraps his legs around behind his head) I got out of school 'cause I told them I was mangled in a car wreck.

APU
Thank you all for the kind praise.

HOMER
Well, you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.

Inside Homer's body, cholesterol makes its way from his stomach to his brain, causing it to spark like electricity.

HOMER
(in a trance) Uh. Apu friend me good.

LISA
I think what my father's saying is, you're like a member of the family now.

APU
I feel that way too. You see...
Whether igloo hut or lean-to, or a geodesic dome,
There's no structure I have been to which I'd rather call my home.

GRAMPA
(Entering) Hello...Aah!

Apu take his cane and he falls down. Music starts and Apu sings.

APU
When I first arrived, you were all such jerks,
But now I've come to looooooove your quirks.
Maggie with her eyes so bright,
Marge with hair by Frank Lloyd Wright,
Lisa can philosophise,
Bart's adept at spinning lies,
Homer's a delightful fella,
Sorry 'bout the salmonella.

HOMER
(spoken) Heh heh, that's okay.

APU
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?
Now here's the tricky part.
Oh, won't you rhyme with me?
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

MARGE
Their floors are stick-E-Mart.

LISA
They made Dad sick-E-Mart.

BART
Let's hurl a brick-E-Mart!

HOMER
The Kwik-E-Mart is real... D'oh!

FAMILY & APU
Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

APU
Not meeee... (held)

FAMILY
(backing) Forget the Kwik-E-Mart,
Goodbye to Kwik-E-Mart,
Who needs the Kwik-E-mart?

APU
Not me!

The song finishes. Apu leaves the room; the family dust themselves off and sit on the sofa.

HOMER
(sighs) Everything really wrapped up nicely. (looks at watch) Hmm, much quicker than usual.

MARGE
I guess we learned that happiness is wherever you find it.

HOMER
And we've all found happiness, every one of us.

He turns on the TV, but hears sobbing coming from outside.

HOMER
Hey, what's that sound?

Apu is sat on the roof of the house.

APU
(lonely singing) Who needs the Kwik-E-Mart? I dooooo...

HOMER
Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song! I hate when people do that!



ACT THREE
In the Simpsons living room.

APU
I can't lie to myself, you know. I do miss my Kwik-E-Mart.

LISA
Isn't there anything you can do to get your job back?

APU
I must go to the head office and appeal my case.

HOMER
I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do. Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing, but I'll go you one better and come along!

APU
But sir, the head office is in India.

HOMER
Okay.

LISA
Dad, that's over ten thousand miles away.

HOMER
I'm aware of that!

LISA
That's over sixteen thousand kilometers!

HOMER
D'oh!

Homer and Apu ride mules across a sandy plain. They reach the edge of a cliff... where Springfield Airport resides in the distance.

APU
I'm sorry we couldn't take a cab, but I spent my last dollar on the plane tickets.

The plane is flying over some mountains.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No.

HOMER
Are we in India yet?

APU
No. Oh wait... now we are.

At the Kwik-E-Mart, James Woods cleans a microwave oven, while on the phone.

WOODS
Tony, T-Tony, you're my agent: you have to do something about this. How can it be the same movie if they're changed my character from a tightly-wound convenience store clerk to a jittery eskimo firefighter? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Hmm. Actually, that's...that's a pretty good explanation. Now this gross, this'll be gross points right in this new...? Okay. Yeah, 'cause those monkeys... yeah, okay, great. Okay, look: book me a flight, rent me an igloo, and tell those dorks at the Kwik-E-Mart that boom! I am outta here, I'm a dot, I'm gone, okay? What do you mean, I gotta give two weeks notice? (tries scraping some cheese off the oven) Why you frickin', no good mother-(beep) (beep-beep-beep-beep) cheese! ...No, not you, I'm just talking to my oven.

Homer and Apu arrive at the airport in India. A group of men are singing in the lounge.

MEN
If you're saved and you know it, clap your hands! If you're saved and you know it, clap your hands!

INDIAN MAN
(sarcastically) Oh, great. Christians.

Homer, Apu, and several other people cling on to the side of a full train.

CONDUCTOR
(on tannoy) Attention passengers, dinner is now being served on the dining car.

The passengers edge their way along the outside of the train, then climb in a window of the next carriage behind. Homer and Apu's journey continues through desert and mountain terrains, ending up out of breath on a twisty mountain pathway.

APU
There she is. There she is, the world's first convenience store.

The camera pans up to show a building at the very top of the mountain.

HOMER
This isn't very convenient.

APU
Must you dump on everything we do?

They approach the store. Inside, an old Hindu man sits towards to rear, drinking a Squishee. A sign behind him reads: "The Master Knows All; Except Combination To Safe"

APU
He is the benevolent and enlightened president and C.E.O. of Kwik-E- Mart - and in Ohio, Stop-O-Mart. He is the one I must ask for my job back.

C.E.O.
Approach, my sons. You may ask me three questions.

APU
That's great, because all I need is one.

HOMER
Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

C.E.O.
Yes.

HOMER
Really?

C.E.O.
Yes.

HOMER
You?

C.E.O.
Yes. I hope this has been enlightening for you.

APU
But, I must--

C.E.O.
Thank you, come again.

APU
But--

C.E.O.
Thank you, come again.

HOMER
(outside the store) Well, that was a big bust. Is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?

Apu reaches out to strangle Homer.

HOMER
No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.

Apu lunges at Homer, strangling him.

HOMER
(choked) Okay, Apu! I accept your apology!

They fall down the side of the mountain. Returning home, the rest of the family run up.

BART & LISA
Dad! Dad! What'd you bring us? What you bring?

MARGE
How did it go?

HOMER
Fine! (Apu scowls) Oh, I mean, not good.

LISA
I'm sorry, Apu. But remember: (sings) who needs the Kwik-E-Mart?

APU
Do you mind? I'm not in the mood.

HOMER
Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.

APU
Yes, yes, you are right, sir. I've got to accept my fate. I have feared it for long enough now. I'm going to go down to the Kwik-E-Mart and I'm going to face my demon!

MARGE
Oh, that'll work out great! We're out of Lucky Charms.

Apu marches into the Kwik-E-Mart, and looks pleased to see something.

APU
Ah, my old Squishee machine. And my scum bucket with flies. And a hot-check list.

James Woods comes to the counter.

WOODS
Hey, you're Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, aren't you? I mean, you're the... God, you're like THE guy, you're a legend around here. Can I ask you, is it true you once worked 96 hours straight?

APU
Oh yes, it was horrible I tell you. By the end I thought I was a hummingbird of some kind.

WOODS
Oh yeah, you know, I studied your old security tapes.

He plays a tape that shows Apu running back and forth, flapping his arms like a bird and making a high-pitched hum.

APU
In a few minutes, I try to drink nectar out of Sanjay's head.

Suddenly, a robber comes in with a gun.

ROBBER
All right, you. Hand over the cash and don't try any funny stuff.

WOODS
Hey, pal, I assure you: if I tried any funny stuff, you would be in hysterics.

ROBBER
Hey, you're James Woods!

WOODS
Oh thank you, yes, thank you.

ROBBER
Well, Mr. Woods, your new song is going to be number three with a bullet!

WOODS
I-- I'm not a singer.

ROBBER
Shut up!

He aims the gun. In slow motion, Apu dives in front of James Woods as the robber fires.

APU
(slow motion) Nooooooo!

The robber runs off.

WOODS
Apu!

APU
(in Woods' arms) The searing kiss of hot lead: how I missed you. I mean, I think I'm dying.

WOODS
(quietly) Hey.

At the hospital, the Simpsons, James Woods and Dr. Hibbert gather round Apu in a bed.

HIBBERT
(chuckling) Well, you are a very lucky man, Apu. You see, the bullet ricocheted off another bullet that was lodged in your chest from a previous robbery.

WOODS
Apu, you saved my life. And as a small token of my appreciation, I got you your job back at the Kwik-E-Mart.

APU
Oh! Oh, Mr. Woods, you're--

WOODS
But as for me, I'm off to battle aliens on a far away planet.

MARGE
That sounds like a good movie!

WOODS
(nervously) Yes. Yes, a...a movie, yes.

He leaves.

HOMER
Hey, let's all hug Apu!

They hug Apu, then stand around as if waiting for something. Homer looks at his watch.

HOMER
Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again!

They hug Apu again. Fade to credits.



#### SET 8 ####
ACT ONE
Homer is playing poker at Lenny's house. Also present are Moe, Barney and Carl.

MOE
All right, I raise a quarter.

LENNY
I'm out.

CARL
I'm out.

BARNEY
I'm out. Whoa!

He passes out and falls off his chair.

MOE
Homer, do you want any cards? Homer!

Homer is choking on something. Moe slaps him on the back, and he coughs up a chip.

HOMER
Whoo! Don't try to eat these so-called 'chips'.

LENNY
You want another card or not?

HOMER
Huh? Oh, okay, I'll take three.

Moe hands Homer three cards in succession.

HOMER
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! Uh, I mean, woohoo.

MOE
I'm in. Let's see your cards.

HOMER
Oh, I was bluffing.

MOE
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Come to papa! I... wait a minute. Homer, you have a straight flush! Oh, you do this every time, you... oh god, I'm choking on my own rage here!

CARL
Hey, don't yell at Homer, just because he's a little slow.

Homer gasps. The shot then pans up to his brain.

HOMER'S BRAIN
Something was said, not good. What was it? Don't yell at Homer? Nah, that's okay. What was it... slow! They called you slow!

HOMER
(standing up and pointing) How dare you call me that! I--

We see that it is now night-time. Lenny is in his dressing gown, raiding the fridge.

LENNY
Hey Homer, are you still here? Boy, you are slow.

Homer gasps. His brain speaks again.

HOMER'S BRAIN
Something said, not good.

LENNY
Get the Hell out of here!

He kicks Homer out.

The next morning. The Simpsons family are eating breakfast.

HOMER
So anyhoo, last night we were playing poker, right. As usual I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm... get this... he he... a little slow! (he roars with laughter, then stops) How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?

BART
(quietly) Buh.

LISA
(quietly) Nah.

MARGE
We don't think you're slow. But on the other hand, it's not like you go to museums, or read books or anything.

HOMER
You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge, they won't let me. One quality show after another, each one fresher ad more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once, just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves! But they won't! They won't let me live! (He sobs.)

Later, in the bedroom.

HOMER
Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow.

MARGE
Oh, Homie, if you feel bad about yourself, there's always things you can do to feel better.

HOMER
Take another bath in malt liquor?

MARGE
There's that. Or you could take an Adult Education Course!

HOMER
Oh. And how is 'education' supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine-making course and I forgot how to drive?

MARGE
That's because you were drunk!

HOMER
And how.

Homer turns up at the Adult Education Annex. A sign reads: "We take the 'dolt' out of a-dolt education". Homer walks past several classrooms. The first class is "How To Turn A Man Into Putty In Your Hands", taught by Patty & Selma.

PATTY
One way to drive your man wild is to wear tight, revealing clothes.

Selma walks out from behind a screen, wearing a tight dress.

CLASS
Eww!

PATTY
At this point I'd like to remind you there are no refunds.

In the next room, Moe is teaching a class called "Funk Dancing For Self Defense".

MOE
All right, here's the four-one-one, folks. Say some gangster is dissing your fly-girl. You just give him one of these.

He plays some funk music and dances. Suddenly, he pulls out a shotgun and shoots into the air.

MOE
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

Homer walks on.

Next, Lenny is teaching "How To Chew Tobacco". He spits some tobacco into the spittoon.

LENNY
See, that 'ping' sound means the spit was on target. Now you try.

The class try, but don't have much luck. Abe Simpson's teeth fall out.

ABE SIMPSON
Oh...

LENNY
Gettin' better.

HOMER
Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him. That's it! If he can teach a class, HE can teach a class! I mean I can teach a class!

Homer is being interviewed by the manager.

MANAGER
What is your area of expertise?

HOMER
Well, I can tell the difference between butter and 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter'.

MANAGER
No you can't, Mr. Simpson, no-one can!

HOMER
Oh, I failed again! Everybody can teach a class but me! I'm an idiot! What am I going to tell my wife and kids?

MANAGER
Oh, you're married?

HOMER
(suggestively) That depends. Is there another way to get this job?

MANAGER
No, Mr. Simpson, what I mean is we may have a job for you after all. We need someone to teach a course on how to build a successful marriage.

HOMER
I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging, and noise... uh, of a family of love. Tra-la-la-la!

At the Simpsons' home. Homer enters the kitchen.

HOMER
Look everyone! Now that I'm a teacher I've sewn patches on my elbows.

MARGE
Homer, that's supposed to be leather patches on a tweed blazer, not the other way around. You've ruined a perfectly good jacket.

HOMER
Ah, incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.

He holds up a tweed blazer, with two patches cut from it.

LISA
I think it's great you're a teacher, Dad. So, will you be lecturing from a standardized text, or using the more socratic method of interactive class participation?

HOMER
(pause) Yes Lisa, Daddy's a teacher.

Homer is driving to his class. He stops outside Ned Flanders' house, gets out the car and rings his bell. Flanders answers the door.

FLANDERS
Well, Homer, what a pleasant--

HOMER
Can't talk now, I've got a class to teach!

FLANDERS
But you rang my--

Homer drive off. His next stop is at the Krusty Burger Drive-Thru.

TEENAGER
Can I take your order?

HOMER
Nothing for me today, I've got a class to teach!

He drives off.

TEENAGER
Sir, it's a felony to tease the order box.

Homer drives across an intersection which is on a red light.

HOMER
It's all right, I'm a teacher!

MISS HOOVER
(also waiting) I didn't know we could do that.

She drives across.

Homer begins his class by writing his name on the blackboard. He makes a terrible screeching noise. His class is attended by several Springfield residents, including Moe, Principal Skinner, Otto, Lenny, Carl, Apu, Mrs. Krebappel, Lionel Hutz, Groundskeeper Willy Waylon Smithers and Sideshow Mel.

HOMER
All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.

Someone spits tobacco at him.

HOMER
Ew! Down the hall, room twelve.

A voice mumbles "Thank you", and spits more tobacco at him.

HOMER
Ew! Okay, let's get started. Uh... Um... Um... Um...

A woman whispers something to Carl.

HOMER
No talking! (he coughs) Um... Um... Oh! Um... Um...

Skinner raises his hand.

SKINNER
Um, how about if we tell you our problems with relationships?

HOMER
Yeah... yeah! That'll eat up some time. How about you... (scans the room) Otto?

OTTO
Well, my standards are just too high, y'know? I feel like nobody's good enough for me.

A flea drops off his head.

OTTO
Wow, you think you've got them all, but you forget about the eggs.

LIONEL HUTZ
My problem is I'm a real user of women. I move in right away, and stay until the money's gone.

MRS. KREBAPPEL
I'm a smart woman, but I make bad choices.

Lionel Hutz whispers to her, and she giggles.

MRS. KREBAPPEL
Okay, here's a set of house keys and my ATM card.

SMITHERS
Um, I was married once, but I just didn't know how to keep it together.

The scene dissolves into Smithers' black-and-white recollection. Smithers uses a crutch to walk, and pours himself a brandy. A woman is on his bed.

WOMAN
Come on, Waylon, make love to me the way you used to.

SMITHERS
No!

WOMAN
It's that horrible Mr. Burns, isn't it?

SMITHERS
(shouting) You leave Mr. Burns out of this!!

He smashes the bottles on the cabinet with his crutch. Mr. Burns calls from outside the room.

MR. BURNS
Smithers!

Smithers rushes out of the room. A half-naked Burns is at the bottom of the stairs.

MR. BURNS
Smithers!!

The scene dissolves back to the classroom. Homer is eating an orange.

SMITHERS
Mr. Simpson, are you listening? Simpson!

HOMER
Huh? Oh yeah, I was listening. Very funny.

MOE
Oh, you were not! You were just eating a damn orange!

HOMER
Yes, to the untrained eye, I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I'm making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange. First, you have the skin. Then the sweet, sweet innards. Mmm...

Homer devours the orange.

APU
I don't understand.

WILLY
If I wanted to see a man eat an orange, I would have taken the orange-eating class!

Cut to another classroom. Hans Moleman is the teacher.

HANS MOLEMAN
The eating of an orange is a lot like a good marriage.

ABE SIMPSON
Just eat the damn oranges!

Back in Homer's class, the students get up and start to leave.

WOMAN
This is terrible.

WILLY
Let's get out of here.

SKINNER
A terrible excuse for education.

HOMER
Oh, I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.

SKINNER
Bed?

MOE
So something wasn't working in bed, huh? Heh heh heh.

HOMER
No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night, we were having a fight about money.

SKINNER
Ooh, a fight!

MOE
Trouble in paradise, heh, heh, heh.

The class return to their places.

HOMER
I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only died her hair once a month.

MRS. KREBAPPEL
Marge dies her hair?

HOMER
Oh yeah, she's been as gray as a mule since she was seventeen.

SIDESHOW MEL
Ooh, tell us more. Tell us about it.

Later that night.

HOMER
I went on for hours, and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.

The shot pans out, and we see that Homer is at the Krusty Burger Drive-Thru again. Several police cars arrive. Chief Wiggum points a megaphone at Homer, as if it were a gun.

WIGGUM
All right, Simpson, you were warned about teasing the box!

HOMER
Aah!

He drives off.

TEENAGER
Wait! I need closure on that anecdote!



ACT TWO
Marge is at the Kwik-E-Mart the next day. She reaches the checkout.

APU
Oh, Mrs. Simpson, it may interest you to know that we are having a sale on blue dye number fifty two. It is your hair color, I believe.

MARGE
Whatever do you mean, I don't dye my hair.

MOE
No, you got it wrong 'pu, she's blue fifty six.

MARGE
I don't know what you're talking about.

Marge leaves the store. Mrs. Krebappel calls after her.

MRS. KREBAPPEL
We just love you're husband's class!

MARGE
(from the car) That's nice!

Back at home.

MARGE
Homer, I really don't like you telling personal secrets in your class.

HOMER
Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.

MARGE
Today at the Kwik-E-Mart, everybody knew I dye my hair.

HOMER
Oh. You mean about you. Well, maybe I said some things, some personal things. But you should have seen them, Marge, they really wanted to hear what I had to say.

MARGE
Mmm, I'm happy about that. But I think you can still be a good teacher and not invade our privacy.

HOMER
Look Marge, you don't know what it's like - I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order! The whole freaking system is out of order! You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do!! Forget it Marge, it's Chinatown!!!

MARGE
Homer, don't ever tell them personal stuff about me again!!

HOMER
(sheepishly) Yes ma'am.

Homer is teaching his class again.

HOMER
What is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary defines a wedding as 'the process of removing weeds from one's garden'.

The class groan.

MOE
Tell us more about you and Marge!

HOMER
This is a place of learning, not a place of... hearing about things.

The class get up to leave.

WOMAN
I guess he's run out of stories.

SKINNER
What a rip-off.

OTTO
I can't believe I paid ten thousand dollars for this course! What the heck was that lab fee for?

HOMER
No wait! Uh, wait, yes! I do have a story about two other young married's.

The class sit back down.

HOMER
Now the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.

MRS. KREBAPPEL
We need names!

HOMER
Well, let's just call them... uh, 'Mr. X' and 'Mrs. Y'. So anyway, Mr. X would say, "Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson!"

The class gasp.

At home, the next evening. The family are in the kitchen.

MARGE
Oh, Homer, don't you have to get to class?

HOMER
Not tonight, Marge. Tonight, we can eat a nice leisurely dinner at home.

MARGE
Well, that will be lovel-- Aah!

She walks into the dining room, and sees Homer's class standing around the table.

MARGE
What the darn?

HOMER
Marge, you'll never guess what! My whole class is here! They're going to observe the human peepshow that is our lives.

The whole family sits down to eat.

SIDESHOW MEL
(to another classmate) Apparently that disturbing odor was the food.

HOMER
So, little Lisa, apple of my eye, how were things down at the old school house?

LISA
I find this demeaning and embarrassing beyond my worst nightmares.

The class scribble on their notepads.

HOMER
(to Bart) And how's my little major-leaguer? Catch any June bugs today?

BART
Well, me and Milhouse took some mail from the mail truck and threw it down the sewer.

HOMER
Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.

BART
What the hell are you talking about? You're the one who double-dared us!

HOMER
Why you little...!

He reaches across the table and strangles Bart. The class continue to make notes.

MARGE
Homer!

BART
I'm out of here!

LISA
Me too!

HOMER
He he he. Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed--

MARGE
I want this to end now!

MOE
Hey Homer, why don't you just nibble her elbow? That always melts her butter, right? Heh, heh, heh.

MARGE
(gasp) All right! Okay! Everybody out!

APU
Ooh, she's gotta have it!

MARGE
Out! Get out, get out, get out out out out!!

She shoos them outside.

HOMER
All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.

MARGE
(to Homer) You too!

HOMER
Huh?

MARGE
Get out!

HOMER
But I'm not in the cla--

Marge pushes him to the ground and slams the door.

OTTO
Is any of this going to be in the test, because I wasn't paying attention.



ACT THREE
Homer is outside on the lawn.

HOMER
Come on, Marge, let me in! There's crickets out here!

Marge opens the door.

HOMER
Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.

He tries to walk back in the house, but Marge blacks him off.

MARGE
You just don't get it, do ya Homer? You told personal things about our lives, even after you promised you wouldn't. I can't trust you any more.

HOMER
But I've learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.

Ned Flanders open his bedroom window next door.

FLANDERS
Hey Homer, what's the big brew-a-ha-ha?

HOMER
Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.

Marge slams the door in his face.

HOMER
Honey, the door blew shut! (pause) Oh, fine. If that's what you want, you've got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road! Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I end up in this crazy old world.

Homer ends up in the tree house. He looks down into the kitchen.

MARGE
Kids, your father and I are going through a really tough time right now, and I don't know what's going to happen. But just remember that both your Mom and your Dad love you very, very much. (She walks off.)

BART
Wow, I've never seen Mom so mad at Homer before.

LISA
I'll tell you a secret, Bart. Every time I'm worried about Mom and Dad, I go to the attic and add to my ball of string.

Cut to the attic, where a huge ball of string crushes Snowball II.

Bart and Milhouse play outside.

BART
Earthbase? This is commander Bart McCool. We are under attack by the Zornid Brain Changers! Quickly, into the safety dome, Milbot!

MILHOUSE
Affirmative, humanoid.

The boys climb into the tree house, where they see Homer washing his underpants.

BART & MILHOUSE
Eww!

HOMER
Don't mind me, boys, just scrubbing my undies.

MILHOUSE
Sorry, Bart. Your dad kind of blew the fantasy. I only like it when I'm pretend-scared.

HOMER
Keep up the roughhousing, son! Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight! (in a sissy voice) Oh, these stubborn grass stains.

Homer sees Reverend Lovejoy coming to the Simpsons' home.

HOMER
Oh, good. Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back! He has to push the sanctity of marriage, or his God will punish him.

REV. LOVEJOY
(inside) Get a divorce.

MRS. LOVEJOY
Mm-hmm.

MARGE
But isn't that a sin?

REV. LOVEJOY
Marge, just about everything is a sin. (holding up a bible) You ever sat down and read this thing?  Technically, we're not allowed to go to the bathroom.

Later that night. Marge is in bed. She reaches across to where Homer usually sleeps. We see that there is a huge dent in the bed. Up in the tree house, Homer holds a picture frame.

HOMER
Good night, Marge.

He turns around, revealing that the frame is empty.

HOMER
Oh, why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture!

Marge is driving into town the next day.

MARGE
Funny the way everything reminds me of Homer.

She passes shops, named "Broken Home Chimney Repairs", "Splitsville Ice Cream Sundaes" and "Painful Memories Party Supplies". She then hear's Homer's voice in her head.

HOMER'S VOICE
I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm going to be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...

She sees Homer in the back seat, talking through a cardboard tube.

HOMER
Together?

Marge skids the car, throwing him out onto the road.

HOMER
Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow!

Lisa visits Homer in the tree house.

LISA
Look Dad, I brought you some-- Aaah!

She sees that Homer is clipping a potted plant to look exactly like Marge.

HOMER
Good news, Lisa! I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement for her that's superior to her in almost every way!

LISA
Dad, that's just a plant.

HOMER
Lisa! You will respect your new mother! Now, give her a kiss. Kiss her!

Homer pushes the plant towards Lisa, but knocks it out of the tree house. It breaks on the ground.

HOMER
Aah! Oh my god oh my god oh my god! (calmly) All right, let's get our stories straight - she tripped, right?

LISA
Look, I brought you some nice pudding.

HOMER
Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart, help me trick her into taking me back!

LISA
Dad, you can't trick somebody into loving you. There's a reason two people come together and stay together - there's something they give each other that nobody else can give them. If you wanna get Mom back, you'll just have to remember what you give her that no one else can.

HOMER
I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.

LISA
No.

HOMER
Okay... thirty.

LISA
Good luck, Dad.

She leaves the tree house.

HOMER
All right,, brain, it's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.

HOMER'S BRAIN
Eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding.

HOMER
Okay. But then we gotta get to work.

Moe arrives at the Simpsons' home.

MOE
Oh, hi, Marge. I heard you and Homer broke up so I'm declaring my intentions to move in on his territory. Here, I uh, brung you some posies.

MARGE
Oh, my! I'm very flattered, but I'm not really interested.

MOE
Jeez, I come here, get dressed up all nice-like, put my heart on the line and I make a fool of myself. Oh, boy. Aw, I'm gonna start bawling here.

MARGE
Why don't you come inside for a drink of water?

MOE
'K.

Moe sits on the couch.

MOE
Clean house, no silver fish. Coulda been very happy here.

Homer enters the living room.

MOE
Homer!

HOMER
Moe! What are you doing here?

MOE
I, um, well, I... I never touched her, Homer. Homer, I swear I never touched her!

MARGE
Here's your water, Moe.

MOE
I didn't ask her for no water! She's lying Homer, she's lying. She told me you were dead. That's the only reason I-- I didn't do nothin'!! (He runs out of the room, and dives out of a window.) Aah!

HOMER
Bye, Moe.

MARGE
Homer, what happened to you?

HOMER
Marge, I finally figured out what I can give you that no one else can - a bouquet of po -- (sees Moe's bouquet) oh! I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.

He walks out of the room, but his rags get caught on the coffee table.

HOMER
Oh... my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.

MARGE
Here, let me help you.

She frees Homer. As he leaves, he has a sudden brainwave.

HOMER
Wait a minute. Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can - complete and utter dependence!!

MARGE
Homer, that's not a good thing.

HOMER
Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you! I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all I need you to love me, 'cause I love you.

MARGE
But how do I know I can trust you?

HOMER
Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours I'll be dead! I can't afford to lose your trust again.

Marge looks into Homer's eyes, then smiles and hugs him.

MARGE
I must admit, you certainly do make a gal feel needed.

HOMER
Wait till my class hears about this! Kidding!

Later that day.

HOMER
Ah! Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family.

LISA
I'm really glad you're back, Dad, I knew you could do it. (quietly) Now don't screw it up.

BART
(showing him a piece of paper) Look Dad, I missed you so much I couldn't concentrate in school and I got an F.

HOMER
Hey, this is dated two weeks ago!

BART
Sorry. Here's a fresh one.

MARGE
(suggestively) And I have a special present for you, but I'll give it to you later tonight.

HOMER
Special present? I don't want to wait! I want it now, I want the children to see-- oh! Oh, right, later, he he.

Moe appears at the kitchen window.

MOE
So, Marge, are you really happy, really?

HOMER
Hey Moe.

MOE
Aah!

He runs off. Fade to credits.



#### SET 9 ####
ACT ONE
The episode starts at Springfield Elementary. The children stand outside. Principal Skinner stands in front of then, wearing goggles.

SKINNER
And now, to top off our most propane-explosion-free science week ever, our grand finale: the launching of a weather balloon!

The children cheer. Bart's voice can be heard over the top.

BART
Go, weather balloon! Hurrah for science, woo!

SKINNER
(quietly) "Hurrah for science, woo"? I can't say I approve of the "woo" but the "hurrah" was quite heartening. (louder) Release the balloon!

Groundskeeper Willy releases the balloon as the kids cheer. As the balloon rises, Bart can be seen holding a piece of string. It is connected to the balloon, and he pulls it sharply. Two flaps on the balloon unroll, revealing a picture of Skinner's head on one side and his legs on the other. A banner on the balloon reads "Hi, I'm Big Butt Skinner". The kids laugh.

SKINNER
Nooooo!!!

Skinner runs after the balloon.

BART
I don't think I really captured the eyes.

MILHOUSE
Bart, if you have a failing, it's that you're always demanding perfection. If you have a failing.

SKINNER
Whoever brings down that balloon doesn't have to learn fractions!

The children cheer and start throwing rocks. Many land on Skinner's car, which is beneath the balloon.

SKINNER
Uh, uh careful, children, that's my car!

Nelson, Jimbo throw several rocks directly at the car.

NELSON
Ha ha!

SKINNER
(to Willy) Destroy that balloon.

WILLY
Aye.

He shoots a gun into the sky several times, as two fighter planes fly past.

PILOT ONE
Tango 14, we're being fired at. I'm getting an exact ID on the boogey now.

A screen flashes "Iraqi Fighter Jet".

PILOT ONE
Iraqis again. Launching sidewinder missile. (A missile is launched and destroys the other plane.) Missed 'em. Launching second sidewinder missile. (The missile destroys his plane, and both pilots parachute.) (to the other pilot) This is what happens when you cut money out of the military and put it into health care!

PILOT TWO
It's a good program! Just give it a chance, that's all I ask!

Suddenly, the parachutes rip, and both pilots fall to the ground. They get straight up and start punching each other. Back at the school, Skinner watches the balloon float off.

SKINNER
Oh, it won't come down for months. Curse the man who invented helium! Curse Pierre-Jules-Cesar Janssen! Now to find out who did this. (He turns to the children.) Bart! Empty your pockets.

BART
Empty my pockets, you say? (he takes things out of his pockets) Well, certainly, but I fail to see how--

Skinner picks up some paper.

SKINNER
Hmm... blueprints of the dummy... notarized photos of you making the dummy... and an alternate wording for the banner, "Buttzilla".

BART
Race you to Utah, Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Okay!

As Bart runs off, Skinner grabs him.

SKINNER
I'm going to punish you for this, Bart. And it won't just be a simple caning this time. Because you have impeded science, you must now aid science. Yes... Starting tomorrow, you will assist me with my amateur astronomy, taking down coordinates, carrying equipment, and so forth. Four-thirty in the morning.

BART
There's a four-thirty in the morning now?

At four o'clock the next morning, Bart's radio alarm clock wakes him up.

RADIO DJ
Top of the hour, time for the morning news. But of course, there is no news yet, everyone's still asleep in their comfy, comfy beds. Good night, everybody.

Bart groans, then gets out of bed and walks to his parents' room.

BART
Mom, will you make me breakfast?

MARGE
(yawns) There's a stuffed pepper in the trash from last night. Just rinse it good.

Downstairs, the pets watch TV. A boy's voice can be heard.

BOY ON TV
Come home, Lassie. Here, boy! Come on, girl. Atta boy!

As Bart comes downstairs, the pets turn the TV off and pretend to be asleep. Bart gets his bike from the garage and leaves the house.

BART
Still dark. Better use the generator.

He turns it on, but the force against his back wheel slows him down enormously. He cycles past the school and meets Skinner nearby.

SKINNER
Ah, there's nothing more exciting than science. You get all the fun of... sitting still, being quiet, writing down numbers, paying attention... Science has it all.

BART
Is that the telescope we're going to be looking through?

SKINNER
Yes, but you won't be looking through it. (he chuckles) I forbid it. But you don't need a telescope to enjoy astronomy, Bart. (pointing) There are all the constellations you've heard so much about. There's Orion, the swan, the chariot race...

BART
Why don't they look anything like their names?

SKINNER
Well, you do have to use your imagination. Look, there's the three wise men.

He points at a constellation which clearly depicts three men.

BART
Who names these things anyway?

SKINNER
Whoever discovers them. I've been hoping I could find something that would be named after me.

BART
And you've never found anything?

SKINNER
Once. But by the time I got to the phone, my discovery had already been reported by Principal Kahoutek. I got back at him, though... him and that little boy of his. Anyway, that's why I always keep a cellular phone next to me. (Skinner gives the phone to Bart, who puts it in his pocket.) Now, this morning we're going to be mapping a small square of sky that's thought to be empty. It's my hope that it's not.

BART
So what am I supposed to do exactly?

SKINNER
Just write down my findings as I give them to you. Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-two minutes declination... no sighting.

BART
Mm-hm.

SKINNER
Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, twenty-three minutes declination... no sighting.

BART
Mm-hm.

The scene fades to later.

SKINNER
(excitedly) Six hours, nineteen minutes, right ascension, fourteen degrees, fifty-eight minutes declination! ...no sighting. Did you get that one Bart?

BART
Hell no.

SKINNER
Good.

Skinner spots something.

SKINNER
My stars! Give me the phone, quick!

He dials the phone. At the Observatory, a woman picks up the phone.

WOMAN
(to a man) Check out 6-19-14-59.

The man focuses on Skinner's weather balloon.

SKINNER
No, there's no need to do that... it's already named after me. (hangs up the phone) It's pretty close to the ground, maybe I can catch it. (as he is about to leave) Don't touch the telescope, Bart. Even a slight change in elevation can destroy a whole morning's work.

He runs off. Bart looks at the telescope, then spins it wildly.

BART
Woo! All hands on deck, pirates off the port bow! (looks into the telescope) Hey... (presses "redial" on the phone) Hello, observatory? This is Bart Simpson. I see something weird in the sky at 4-12-8 and the last number is 7.

Skinner is on top of the climbing frame. He manages to catch the balloon.

SKINNER
Ah, got you, my rumpy doppelganger. (he floats to the ground) I've got it! I-- (sees Bart on the phone) what are you doing? Give me that phone!

WOMAN
(on phone) Congratulations, Bart. You've just discovered a comet.

SKINNER
Nooooo! (lets go of balloon accidentally) Nooooo!!! (a paper boy rides by, throwing a paper in front of him with the headline "Prez Sez: school is for losers") NOOOOO!!!



ACT TWO
It is dinner time at the Simpson home.

HOMER
And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.

LISA
Sounds like you had a good day today, Dad.

HOMER
Yeah... 'cept I forgot to go to work.

MARGE
What did you do today, Bart?

BART
What didn't I do? (he holds up a newspaper)

MARGE
(reading) "Boy Discovers Comet".

LISA
What?

MARGE
(reading) "A young Springfieldianite has discovered a new comet to be known as the 'Bart Simpson Comet'." Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.

BART
But then, you've always been proud of me.

MARGE
(pause) Yes...

The next day, Bart looks for somewhere to sit in the canteen. A boy calls to him.

HAM
Won't you join us, Bart?

BART
(looking around) Uh... I guess so.

DATABASE
As the first student at Springfield Elementary to discover a comet, we're very proud to make you a member of our very select group. Welcome to Super Friends.

BART
Huh?

SUPER FRIENDS
Welcome, Super Friend!

HAM
I am called Ham, since I enjoy ham radio. (pointing to the kids around the table) This is Email... Cosine... Report Card... Database... and Lisa. Your nickname will be Cosmos.

BART
Well, I'm done eating. Goodbye.

SUPER FRIENDS
Goodbye, Cosmos!

HAM
Bye bye!

DATABASE
Perhaps some night you could show us your comet.

BART
(pointing out the window) There it is right there.

DATABASE
I make it a point to never to turn my head unless I expect to see something, Bart. Naturally, we can't see your comet in broad daylight and without a telescope.

BART
But you don't need a stupid telescope. (pointing) It's right there.

The kids see it and gasp.

EMAIL
Oh no, no, no, no, this isn't right at all!

DATABASE
It must be coming toward us at a fantastic speed.

BART
Huh?

LISA
Don't you realize what's happening, Bart? Your comet is going to collide with the Earth and every living thing in its path will be killed!

BART
I knew you'd try to find something wrong with my comet, Lisa. You've always been petty and small, right from the beginning.

REPORT CARD
We must alert the proper authorities.

EMAIL
To the observatory!

The kids ride up to the observatory, singing.

SUPER FRIENDS
We are the Super Friends!

BART
Hey, shut up!

Inside the Observatory, the man looks through the telescope.

MAN
Dear God!

WOMAN
Warren, we've talked about you hogging the eye piece.

A siren sounds. Grampa and Jasper are sat outside in the street

ABRAHAM
Sounds like the doomsday whistle! Ain't been blown for nigh onto three years.

JASPER
(tutting) Trouble a-brewing.

Mayor Quimby calls a meeting at the town hall.

QUIMBY
Fellow citizens, when I learned about the impending crisis, I caught the very next plane to Springfeld... field.

Everyone applauds.

QUIMBY
First of all, yes, there is a comet in the sky, and yes, it is going to hit Springfield.

A few people clap.

QUIMBY
You, er, don't need to applaud that. Now, here's what we think the impact might look like. Show them, Jerry.

A man shows slides the comet approaching Springfield, then the explosion. Moe's bar is labeled.

MOE
Oh dear God, no!

The next slide shows a crater with "charred corpses" around it. The townspeople gasp.

QUIMBY
Fortunately we have a plan. Professor Frink?

FRINK
Ng-hey, good evening, ladies and gentlemen--

MAN
Quit stalling!! What's the plan?!

FRINK
All right, just take your seat, just take your seat. (he unveils a model of the city) Now, working with former Carter Administration officials and military men who were forced into early retirement for various reasons which we won't go into here, ng-hey, we have planned this defense for the city. (he flicks a switch, and the model starts moving) As the comet hurtles towards the city, our rocket will intercept it and blow it to smithereens.

The model rocket hits the comet as it approaches. The comet explodes and Moe's catches fire.

MOE
Oh dear God, no!

QUIMBY
And that will be the end of, er, Mr. Comet.

CROWD
(cheering) We're saved!

Outside, they point and laugh at the comet. Lisa looks worried.

The Simpsons drive home.

HOMER
Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed, didn't you hear what that guy in the building said?

LISA
But Dad, don't you think--

HOMER
Ah-ah! Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rainforest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it, didn't they?

LISA
No, Dad, I don't think--

HOMER
Ah-ah! There's that word again.

Everyone watches the comet approaching in the sky. At the Springfield Armory, the rocket is raised, ready to be fired. A label on the side reads, "Caution: aim way from face". The family sit on lawn chairs on their roof.

MARGE
Homer, what if this doesn't work?

HOMER
Well, then I have a backup plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do- do- do- do- do, do- do- do- do...

BART
Dad! The plan!

HOMER
I'm getting to that! So anyway, they're going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...

BART
Dad!!

HOMER
So anyway, we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do- do- do- do- do, do- do- do- do...

LISA
Dad, they're firing the rocket!

The blast knocks Homer backwards off his chair.

HOMER
All right!

The rocket climbs up and up, towards the comet... and passes right in front of it, down, and destroys the bridge. The citizens of Springfield all do the collar-pull thing.

LISA
It blew up the bridge! We're doomed!

HOMER
It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
(running past) It's all over, people! We don't have a prayer! Ahh...



ACT THREE
The Simpsons watch the news.

KENT BROCKMAN
The rocket foolishly soared too high, and lost control of its servo guidance mechanism, leaving us with some... (looking at his watch) six hours to live. (A screen behind him displays a countdown timer) So, let's go live now to the charred remains of the only bridge out of town with Arnie Pie and Arnie in the Sky!

ARNIE
With the bridge gone and the airport unfortunately on the other side of the bridge, a number of citizens are attempting to jump the gorge with their cars. It's a silent testament to the never-give-up and never-think-things-out spirit of our citizens.

KENT BROCKMAN
With our utter annihilation imminent, our federal government has snapped into action. We go live now via satellite to the floor of the United States congress.

SPEAKER
Then it is unanimous, we are going to approve the bill to evacuate the town of Springfield in the great state of--

CONGRESSMAN
Wait a second, I want to tack on a rider to that bill - $30 million of taxpayer money to support the perverted arts.

SPEAKER
All in favor of the amended Springfield-slash-pervert bill?

FLOOR
Boo!

SPEAKER
Bill defeated.

KENT BROCKMAN
I've said it before and I'll say it again: democracy simply doesn't work. Now, over the years, a newsman learns a number of things that for one reason or another, he just cannot report. It doesn't seem to matter now, so... the following people are gay.

A list of names scroll up the screen very quickly.

MARGE
Turn it off!

HOMER
(writing the names down) Just a second... (Marge turns the television off) What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet, big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left will be no bigger than a Chihuahua's head.

BART
Wow, Dad, maybe you're right.

HOMER
Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow. (everyone groans) Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter.

LISA
We have a bomb shelter?

HOMER
Homer Simpson takes care of his family. (cut to Homer banging on a door) Flanders! Open up!

NED
Heidy-hoeroony, neighbor. What can I do you for?

HOMER
Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.

MARGE
Homer!

NED
Uh oh, I kind of figured this might happen, so I built the shelter big enough for both our families.

HOMER
No deal, out!

MARGE
Get in the shelter, Homer!

The shadow of the comet looms over the city. Some penguins in the zoo fly off, a paperboy abandons his bike and hides under a bench. Several cars are left abandoned in the street. Back in the shelter, the families are bored.

MARGE
(looking at her watch) One more hour.

HOMER
An hour? I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet? (someone bangs on the door) Ah, there it is.

Ned answers it, to find all the townspeople stood outside.

NED
Well, howdily-doodily, neighbors. Shouldn't you be in your shelterini's by now?

MOE
We haven't got shelterini's. We want in yours!

NED
Ho ho, well sorry, the shelter's kind of full.

MOE
Really? Oh. Well, we'll just go off some place and die then. Thanks.

Everyone walks off.

NED
Wait! You know, I may regret this when our air runs out and we can't whistle or stay alive... but oh, what the hey.

Everyone rushes in. The shelter is very crowded. Waldo (from Where's Waldo) can also be seen. Homer tries to shut the door.

HOMER
(struggling) I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.

LISA
(muffled) I'd get out but I don't know where I am.

BARNEY
Hey! Somebody's touching me!

SKINNER
I am.

BARNEY
Oh, okay!

KRUSTY
Okay okay, let's figure out who should stay. (pulls out a notepad) Let's see... the world of the future will need laughter, so I'm in.

MOE
And they'll need somebody to dispense drinks, i.e. me, um, and someone'll have to run the power. Uh, you can do that, Homer.

HOMER
Uh, yeah... I can do that...

The comet approaches. Everyone is still trying to figure out who should get out.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Okay, let's start again. We'll need laughter, religious enlightenment, gossip - that's Mrs. Lovejoy...

HOMER
Wait a minute! We all know the one thing we won't need in the future! Left-handed stores. That's you, Flanders! (aside to Rod and Todd) I'm terribly story. (aloud) Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. (aside) I'm sorry, please forgive me. (aloud) So let's kick Flanders out. (aside) Sorry.

NED
Well sir, sounds fair. Toodleloo, everybody, I-I'll scream when the comet gets here.

MAUDE
Oh, I'm coming with you, Neddy.

NED
No, sweetheart, you... you stay here, because--

MAUDE
Okay.

NED
I might go mad with fear out there, so Todd, I want you to shoot Daddy if he tries to get back in.

TODD
(crying) Okay, Dad.

NED
Okay. (He leaves and starts singing.) Que sera sera, whatever will be, will be...

The shelter is very quiet.

MOE
Hey, uh, I got an idea: we can play a game to pass the time. Uh, I'll make the sound of a barnyard animal, and, er, you all try to guess what it is.

He makes a strange, unrecognizable noise.

WIGGUM
It's a pig!

BART
It's a cow, man!

LISA
It's a pony!

KRUSTY
No, it's a goat. You know, one of them lady goats.

SELMA
There are no lady goats. A lady goat is a sheep.

DR. HIBBERT
I believe she's right.

OTTO
You're crazy!

CAPTAIN MCCALLISTER
Arr, what's it to you?

OTTO
What's it to me?

Everyone starts arguing.

MARGE
Stop it! Stop it! Can't you see this barnyard noise guessing game is tearing us apart?

Everyone is silent. Ned can be heard, still singing.

NED
Whatever will be, will be...

MARGE
Say, Moe, was it a duck?

Everyone starts arguing again.

HOMER
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it! Stop it! I can't take this any more. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you! Especially his
children. I'm going out there! (he goes out, slamming the door behind him, then puts his head back round the door) And it was a baby ox!

MOE
He's right, you know.

SKINNER
About the ox?

MOE
About everything, dammit! Hey Homer, wait up. I want to die too!

APU
If you are going, I am going.

BARNEY
Me too!

OTTO
I'm outa here!

WIGGUM
Yeah!

OTTO
The reception in there sucked.

Everyone leaves. Outside on a hilltop, Ned sings to himself.

NED
When I was just a little girl,
I asked my mother, "What will I be?
Will I be pretty? Will I be rich?"
Here's what she said to me...

The townspeople walk up the hill, singing.

EVERYONE
Que sera, sera,
Whatever will be, will be,
The future's not ours to see,
Que sera se--

QUIMBY
(pointing skywards) Run!

The comet enters the atmosphere, breaking up.

MARGE
Look!

LISA
It's breaking up!

The comet breaks up more, until it becomes just a small rock. The rock makes a hole in Skinner's weather balloon, deflating it, then rebounds off Ned's bomb shelter, knocking it to the ground. Ned and Moe look on and gasp, while the comet bounces up the hillside. Bart picks it up.

BART
Cool!

LISA
We're saved!

Everyone cheers.

SELMA
Sure makes you appreciate the preciousness of life. (lights a cigarette)

MOE
Let's go burn down the observatory so this'll never happen again.

Everyone leaves, except for the Simpson family.

LISA
I can't believe that extra-thick layer of pollution that I've picketed against is what burned up the comet.

BART
But what's really amazing, is that this is exactly what Dad said would happen.

LISA
Yeah, Dad was right...

HOMER
I know, kids. I'm scared too!

Fade to credits.



#### SET 10 ####
ACT ONE
Leonard Nimoy is sitting behind a desk in a darkened room.

NIMOY
Hello, I'm Leonard Nimoy. The following tale of alien encounters is true. And by true, I mean false. It's all lies. But they're entertaining lies, and in the end, isn't that the real truth? The answer...is no. Our story begins on a Friday morning, in a little town called Springfield...

He opens a book which has a picture of Homer in it. The drawing dissolves to Homer at the plant.

HOMER
T.G.I.F.! Guys, I'm off to Moe's.

LENNY
But Homer, it's ten in the morning!

HOMER
Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to SPEED around the city, keeping its SPEED over fifty. And if its SPEED dropped, it would explode. I think it was called... "The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down." First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so, then I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop. (The tape from the 1970's has Homer eating donuts in a "Sit On It" T-shirt, and talking to Lenny. Then, the tape abruptly cuts to Lenny doing a Saturday Night Fever style move - flares and all)

Pan out to Burns office, where he and Smithers watch the tape on the monitor.

BURNS
So, another Friday is upon us. What will you be doing Smithers? Something gay no doubt?

SMITHERS
What? What?

BURNS
You know: light-hearted, fancy-free, mothers lock up your daughters! Smithers is on the town! (chuckles)

SMITHERS
(laughs) Exactly, sir. (laughs nervously)

At the retirement home.

JASPER
Thank God it's Wednesday. (swallows cup of pills)

MRS. GLICK
It's Friday.

JASPER
Uh oh, wrong pills. (he suddenly grows hairy) Uh, little help?

At Noiseland Arcade: "Friday, Meet Donkey Kong In Person". Donkey Kong is smoking and scratching himself, without an audience.

SARCASTIC CLERK
Sorry, Donkey Kong, but you're just not a draw anymore. (Donkey Kong throws a barrel, and knocks him down) Hey, he's still got it!

Inside, Milhouse plays Kevin Costner's Waterworld.

MILHOUSE
(putting money in) 38, 39, 40 quarters. This better be good.

The character in the game moves two steps, and stops.

GAME
Game over, please deposit 40 quarters.

MILHOUSE
What a rip!

But he starts depositing quarters again.

DR HIBBERT
Thank God it's Friday!

He hums as he leaves, closing the door to reveal Hans Moleman stood behind an X-Ray machine.

MOLEMAN
Hello? Hello?

At the Simpson home, the living room looks spotless...however it's just a picture in a magazine entitled "Better Homes Than Yours". Santa's Little Helper chews on a chair, and Snowball II scratches the furniture.

MARGE
Bad dog! Bad cat! (A fawn licks something off the carpet) Bad Fawn! Hmmm...Shoo shoo!

Bart and Lisa are in the den watching television.

LISA
All right! It's time for ABC's T.G.I.F. line-up!

BART
Lis, when you get a little older, you'll realize that Friday is just another day between NBC's Must-See Thursday and CBS's Saturday night Crap-o-Rama.

At Moe's Tavern.

MOE
Another Duff, Homer?

HOMER
Nah, it's Friday night, Moe. I want to try something special.

MOE
Sure, sure. (writes on a bottle) Here you go, Düff. From Sweden, huh huh.

HOMER
Goal! (takes a sip) Wait a minute, this is Duff!

MOE
Heh heh, you got me didn't you? Okay, here you go, Red Tick Beer.

HOMER
Mmm...bold, refreshing, and something I can't quite put my finger on.

At the beer processing plant, dogs are swimming in a vat of beer, a tester tastes some

TESTER
Hmm, needs more dog.

HOMER
Well, it's 1am. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.

MOE
Just a second, Homer. You gotta take a breathalyzer test before I let you drive home.

The machine reads Tipsy, Soused, Stinkin', Boris Yeltsin. Homer gets the latter.

HOMER
Uh, I guess I'll walk home. (walks out, swaying) Ohh...

He walks down eerie roads. He hears scary, Psycho-esque music and a light comes towards him. It turns out to be a bus for the Springfield Philharmonic orchestra. The bus stops and a violinist gets off. Homer continues on his way, and comes across a billboard reading "DIE". He screams, but then a gust of wind blows a tree out of the way to reveal it actually says "DIET". He screams louder and runs off towards the woods. Grampa emerges from the undergrowth.

GRAMPA
Oh, son I'm glad to see you! I went for the morning paper and I got lost! And--

HOMER
No time for you, old man!

He pushes him over, then while running trips over a root. He becomes bathed in a green light, and X-Files-style music is heard. A green glow moves towards him, and an alien-looking figure can be seen.

HOMER
Please, don't hurt me!

ALIEN
(with a soft voice) Don't be afraid.

HOMER
Yahhh!

Homer runs through a field of long grass, creating the pattern "Yahhh!"



ACT TWO
Back at home, Homer bursts into the bedroom.

MARGE
Homer, it's 2am. What happened?

HOMER
It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, "Don't be afraid"!

MARGE
Have you been drinking?

HOMER
No! Well, ten beers.

MARGE
Hmmm...

The next morning.

HOMER
I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.

LISA
Maybe you just dreamed it.

HOMER
Oh yeah? Well when I came to I was covered with a sticky, translucent goo. Explain that!

MARGE
More sausage? (Homer drools)

LISA
Dad, according to Junior Skeptic Magazine, the chances are 175 million to one of another form of life actually coming into contact with ours.

HOMER
So?

LISA
It's just that the people who claim they've seen aliens are always pathetic lowlifes with boring jobs. Oh, and you, Dad. (chuckles nervously)

Bart runs in with a water pistol, and slinky eyes.

BART
I am the thing... from Uranus!

HOMER
Ahhh! Oh, it's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked, by my own children...on my birthday.

BART
It's your birthday?

HOMER
Yes! Remember? It's the same day as the dog's.

LISA
Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? Ooh, we've got to get you a present. Yes we do. Yes we do! (runs to the dog)

BART
We love you.

MARGE
Good doggy, good doggy! (Lisa, Bart, Marge and Maggie all hug the dog)

HOMER
Lousy loveable dog.

At the nuclear plant, Homer tells his colleagues about the experience.

HOMER
Oh, it was awful. They sat me on a cold, metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes. And--oh, wait, that was my physical.

CARL
Great story Homer, really.

The crowd groans and leaves. Homer takes a trip to the police station.

HOMER
The alien has a sweet heavenly voice...like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night...like Urkel!

WIGGUM
Well your story is very compelling, Mr. Jackass, I mean Simpson. So I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. (Hums and makes typing motion in the air)

HOMER
Ugh, you don't have to humiliate me.

He leaves, and another man walks in, with scorched clothing.

ARSONIST
I just torched a building downtown, and I'm afraid I'll do it again!

WIGGUM
Oh, yeah right. I'll just type it up on my invisible typewriter. (Hums and types again) Fruitcake.

Establishing shot outside a building. Text appears on-screen as if being typed, a la The X Files:
FBI
DIVISION OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Inside, there is a picture of J. Edgar Hoover in a dress, Scully is typing on the computer. Mulder enters the room.

MULDER
Look at this Scully. (He shows her the Springfield Shopper newspaper, with headline: "Human Blimp Sees Flying Saucer" and a picture of Homer) There's been another unsubstantiated UFO sighting in the heartland of America. We've got to get there right away.

SCULLY
Well, gee Mulder. There's also this report of a shipment of drugs and illegal weapons coming into New Jersey tonight.

MULDER
I hardly think the FBI is concerned with matters like that.

Mulder and Scully visit the Simpsons home. Mulder knocks on the door, and Marge answers.

MARGE
Hello. Can I help you?

MULDER
Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.

MARGE
Is this about that pen that I took from the post office? I swear, I didn't know I put it in my purse, then I was going to bring it back but the dog chewed it up, and that just made things worse. (she hyperventilates)

SCULLY
Actually, we're here to see your husband about his UFO encounter.

MARGE
(still hyperventilating) Oh...come...come in.

At the FBI Springfield Branch (Invading Your Privacy For 60 Years). A line-up takes place.

SCULLY
Mr. Simpson, look at this line-up and tell us if any of these is the aliens you saw.

The aliens are Marvin the Martian, Robocop, Chewbacca, Alf, and either Kang or Kodos.

ALF
Yo!

HOMER
No, I'm sorry.

The aliens all mutter and leave.

MARVIN
This makes me very angry!

In an interrogation room, Cigarette Smoking Man hides in a corner, while Scully prepares tests.

SCULLY
Now we're going to run a few tests. This is a simple lie detector. I'll ask you a few 'yes or no' questions, and you just answer truthfully. Do you understand?

HOMER
Yes! (The machine blows up)

In another lab, Scully taps Homer's knee for reflex. A very long time later, Homer feels it.

HOMER
Ow!

Next Homer is on a treadmill in just his underpants, with electrodes attached to him.

MULDER
Wait a minute, Scully. What's the point of this test?

SCULLY
No point. I just thought he could stand to lose a little weight.

MULDER
His jiggling is almost hypnotic.

SCULLY
Yes. It's like a lava lamp.

Establishing shot outside Moe's. The phrase "ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY" is typed over and over on screen.

MULDER
All right Homer. We want you to recreate your every move the night you saw this alien.

HOMER
Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.

SCULLY
Mr. Simpson, it's a felony to lie to the FBI.

HOMER
We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?

HOMER
(Several beers later) You are one fine looking woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that! (stamps bottle on bar, and it fizzes over) I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God I love her! Hey, a penny! (Dives to grab it)

MOE
So uh, so what are you guys anyhow?

MULDER
Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.

MOE
FBI, huh? Uh, 'scuse me. (Goes to the back room, where two guys are hosing down a whale) All right, they're on to us. Get him back to Sea World!

HOMER
(Even more drunk) So I said, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same colour in the end.

SCULLY
Homer, why don't you show us where you went when you left the bar.

HOMER
(In the forest) I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods.

There is a rustling from a bush, and Grampa emerges.

GRAMPA
For the love of God help me! I've been here for four days, and a turtle's got a hold of my teeth! There he is. (Chases the turtle) Come back here, you! Slow down! I'll get you...

SCULLY
This is the worst assignment we've ever had.

MULDER
Worse than the time we were attacked by the flesh-eating virus?

The turtle bites Grampa.

GRAMPA
Ow, it bit me with my own teeth!

SCULLY
No, this is much more irritating. I've seen enough Mulder, let's go.

MULDER
Yeah okay. But somewhere out there, something is watching us. There are alien forces acting in ways we can't perceive. (Scully rolls her eyes, and leaves) Are we alone in the universe? Impossible. When you consider the wonders that exist all around us. (hours later) Voodoo priests of Haiti, Tibetan Numerologists of Appalachia. The unsolved mysteries of...unsolved mysteries. The truth...is out there!

Moe and the two guys from the bar come pass carrying the whale.

MOE
Who would have thought a whale could be so heavy? Cheese it, the Feds! (they run off)

That night at the Simpson home. Homer and Marge are in bed.

HOMER
Oh Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. (pause) Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say, "I believe you, Homer."

MARGE
I don't believe you, Homer.

HOMER
You do! Oh Marge, you've made me so happy!

MARGE
Hmm... you're not listening. You're only hearing what you wanna hear.

HOMER
Thanks, I'd love an omelette right about now.

MARGE
Homer, please! I try to be supportive, but this has gone to far. Please just let it be.

HOMER
No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo 3?

MARGE
Please, let's just go to sleep.

HOMER
No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous. Rrrr!

MARGE
No I'm not.

HOMER
Well then, good night.

Homer is sat in the kitchen. Bart enters.

BART
Hey Dad. What's the word from planet crackpot?

HOMER
Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me too.

BART
Well actually dad, I believe you.

HOMER
You do?

BART
Yes, I do. You seem so damn sure.

HOMER
Thank you son. And do you think you can stop the casual swearing?

BART
Hell, yes.

HOMER
That's my boy. If you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods and we're going to find that alien!

BART
What if we don't?

HOMER
We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.

BART
(chuckling) They'll buy anything.

HOMER
Now son, they do a lot of quality programming too. (Pause, then they both laugh hard) I kill me.

At the woods, Homer and Bart camp out. Frogs sit on lily pads in a pond.

FROG 1
Bud...

FROG 2
...weis...

FROG 3
...er!

FROG 1
Bud...

FROG 2
...weis...

FROG 3
...er!

And alligator surfaces and eats the frogs.

ALLIGATOR
Coors!

BART
Yo, dad can I have a sip of your beer?

HOMER
Now son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for daddies and kids with fake ID's. Besides, it's such a beautiful night, how about a ghost story?

BART
(Sometime later) ...And that, is how much college will cost for Maggie.

HOMER
No! No! Nooo!!

BART
(later again) You know dad, it doesn't matter that we didn't see the alien. I've really had a great time out here.

HOMER
Yeah, me too.

Suddenly, there is a green glow, and the X-Files theme is heard. The alien emerges from the woods.

HOMER
It's him!

ALIEN
I bring you peace.

HOMER
As a representative of Planet Earth, let me be the first to say... (Steps in the camp fire) Ahhh! (screams more)

ALIEN
Ahhh! (it runs off)

HOMER
D'oh! It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.

BART
Oh yes we do, I got it all on tape! (holds up camcorder)

HOMER
Good work son! We did it! We did it!

They high five, and we dissolve back into the storybook. Leonard Nimoy closes the book.

NIMOY
And so, from this simple man came the truth, that we are not alone in the universe. I'm Leonard Nimoy, good night.

TEENAGER
(from off-screen) Uh Mr. Nimoy, we have ten minutes left.

NIMOY
Oh, fine. Let me, uh, just get, uh...something out of my car. (runs off and car is heard driving away)

TEENAGER
(walking into camera shot) I don't think he's coming back.



ACT THREE
BROCKMAN
Tonight on Eye-Witness News: A man who's been in a coma for 23 years wakes up.

MAN
(In a hospital room) Do Sonny and Cher still have that stupid show?

BROCKMAN
No, she won an Oscar, and he's a congressman.

MAN
Good night! (he dies)

BROCKMAN
But first, ET phone Homer. Simpson, that is.

HOMER
Marge, kids, they're about to show my videotape! (everyone rushes in)

BROCKMAN
Local man Homer Simpson, shown here with his tongue stuck to a lamp post (File Photo displayed), has given us this videotape. It's a close encounter, of the blurred kind. (chuckles)

ALIEN
(on the video) I bring you peace.

BROCKMAN
The alien has appeared in the same Springfield pasture the last two Friday nights. Will it appear again this Friday? The entire channel six news team will be there, except for Phil, the boom mike operator, who's getting fired tomorrow. (He is hit on the head with the boom) Ow! Very unprofessional, Phil.

BART
Well, Lis. What do you think about the alien now?

LISA
I think there must be a more logical explanation. And I think the people of this town aren't going to be won over by three seconds of videotape.

The doorbell rings, and Homer is greeted by a large crowd.

HOMER
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Dr Hibbert?

DR HIBBERT
Yes, is the alien carbon-based or silicon-based?

HOMER
Uh, the second one. Zillophone. Next question.

BARNEY
Is the alien Santa Claus?

HOMER
Uh, yes.

FLANDERS
Uh, were you on my roof last night stealing my weather vane?

HOMER
This interview is over! (Slams door, and the weather vane falls)

At the church.

REVEREND LOVEJOY
I remember another gentle visitor from the heavens, he came in peace, and then died. Only to come back to life. His name was... E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. I loved that little guy.

It is Friday night. A 'Welcome Alien' banner is in the woods, and the band plays 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Everyone is in the woods waiting for the alien. Jimbo Jones has a sign, 'Alien Dude: Need Two Tickets to Pearl Jam'

BART
Leonard Nimoy! What are you doing here?

NIMOY
Wherever there is a mystery and the unexplained, cosmic forces shall draw me near.

BART
(unimpressed) Uh-huh.

HOT DOG VENDOR
Hey, Spock, what do you want 0n your hot dog?

NIMOY
Surprise me.

He sticks a load of veg on it. Homer looks at the T-shirt sales.

HOMER
Take a look at this Lisa. (Holds up 'Homer Was Right' T-Shirt) You don't see any "Homer Is A Dope" T-shirts, do you?

T-SHIRT VENDOR
We sold those out in five minutes.

HOMER
D'oh! (Marge and Maggie are wearing "Homer is a Dope" shirts) Marge, how could you?

MARGE
These shirts are 100% cotton, and look at the fine stitching on "Dope".

HOMER
I'll take two.

Suddenly, the clouds draw together as the alien approaches.

KRUSTY
Ahhh!

HOMER
Look. There it is!

MARGE
Oh, Homie. Homie, I'm so sorry I doubted you.

ALIEN
I bring you love!

DR HIBBERT
Is that the love between a man and a woman, or the love of a man for a fine Cuban cigar? (chuckles)

ALIEN
Uh...I bring you love!

LENNY
It's bringing love, don't let it get away!

CARL
Break its legs!

LISA
Wait! You want an alien? This is your alien!

Lisa shines her torch on it, and it is revealed to be Mr. Burns.

BURNS
Hello, children. I bring you love.

WILLY
It's a monster! Kill it! Kill it!

SMITHERS
It's not a monster, it's Mr. Burns.

WILLY
Aw, it's Mr. Burns. Kill it! Kill it!

SMITHERS
No, let me explain. Every Friday evening after work Mr. Burns undergoes a series of medical treatments designed to cheat death for another week. (Burns is on a conveyor belt) First Mr. Burns' chiropractors perform a slight spinal adjustment. Then a team of doctors administer his eye drops, pain killers, and a vocal cord straightening.

DR. NICK
Don't worry, you won't feel a thing. (Holds up huge instrument) Till I jam this down your throat!

SMITHERS
The whole ordeal leaves Mr. Burns twisted and disoriented. (Burns wanders into the woods dazed and confused)

DR NICK
(At the door of the hospital) The most rewarding part was when he gave me my money.

Back at the woods.

BART
But what's with the glowing?

MR. BURNS
Um, I'll field that question. A lifetime of working in a nuclear power plant has given me a healthy green glow. And left me as impotent as a Nevada Boxing Commissioner. And now that I'm back to normal, I don't bring you peace and love, I bring you fear, famine, pestilence, and--

DR NICK
Time for a booster! (Jabs in a needle)

Music starts and the crowd begins to sing.

MR. BURNS
Good morning star shine. The Earth says hello!

NIMOY
You twinkle above us, we twinkle below.

EVERYONE
Good morning star shine, you meet us along...

Music and singing continues as Homer and Marge talk.

MARGE
Well, you said you'd bring them peace and love, and it looks like you did it. I'm proud of you Homie.

HOMER
Thanks, Marge.

TEENAGER
(Closes the storybook) And so concludes our tale. I'm Leonard Nimoy. Goodnight, and keep watching the skis. Uh, skies.



#### SET 11 ####
ACT ONE

The episode opens with the Krusty the Klown show, and Krusty is covered in cream pies.

KRUSTY
I hope you enjoyed my one-man pie fight, kids! Now it's time for another fanschmabulous episode of... Itchy and Scratchy!

The episode is titled "Why Do Fools Fall In Lava?" Itchy makes Scratchy bungee jump into a volcano using his intestine. Scratchy dangles just above the lava, and Itchy pours gasoline into him until Scratchy goes up in flames. The Simpsons TV is turned on, displaying this episode, but with no one watching. Marge walks through the living room and notices.

MARGE
Kids? Kids? (She finds her children eating cereal in the kitchen.) You're missing the Itchy & Scratchy Show. Don't you like it anymore?

LISA
(reading the back of a cereal box) Sure, we love it. But how can we watch TV when it's so beautiful out? (pointing out the window)

BART
Well, yeah, Mom. I mean, we love you and Dad too, but God knows we don't need to see you every day.

MARGE
An occasional hug is all I ask. (hugs him)

BART
Mom! You can hug me when I'm asleep.

MARGE
I do!

BART
Ahhh!

At Krustylu studios, Roger Meyers Jr. comes to Krusty's office.

MEYERS
Hey, Krusty, you look great. You get your teeth bleached?

KRUSTY
Yeah, it's a new kind of polymer treatment... Hey, shut up! You're here 'cause your Itchy & Scratchy cartoons are stinking up my ratings. Look at this breakdown of yesterday's show. (He shows Meyers the ratings graph, with a huge dip in) Eh, eh, eh, KABOOM!

MEYERS
What happened here? Lightning hit the transmitter?

KRUSTY
See, that's what I thought at first, but then... Hey, shut up! That crater is where you lousy cartoon crash landed. It's ratings poison.

MEYERS
But Itchy & Scratchy is critically acclaimed!

KRUSTY
Acclaimed!? (spits) I oughta replace it right now with that Chinese cartoon where the robots that turn into... blingwads! (sits down in his chair) But I'm a lazy, lazy man, Roger. So I'll give you one more chance. Get out! Don't come back 'til you fixed "Itchy & Scratchy"!

Meyers walks out, slamming Krusty's office door so hard that it comes of the hinges and falls to the floor. Sideshow Mel can be seen outside.

SECRETARY
(off screen) Okay Mel, you can go in now.

Sideshow Mel enters, holding a tin can.

SIDESHOW MEL
Krusty, I've come to solicit donations for the Rock 'N Roll museum, and... (Krusty stares at him) Uh... I'll come back later.

At Springfield Mall, Marge is shopping with the kids.

MARGE
I need to purchase a brassiere. You kids wait over here in the credit department.

BART
Oh, can't we just wander around and meet you back here later?

MARGE
Mmm...okay, just be careful.

Bart and Lisa run off. They run into a creepy-looking guy.

MAN
Would you kids like to come with me?

BART
(simultaneously with Lisa) Sounds good to me! Let's go!

LISA
(simultaneously with Bart) Okay! Guess so.

Bart & Lisa participate in a focus group, along with several other kids including Milhouse, Nelson and Ralph.

MAN
Alright, thanks for participating in our focus group, kids. Today, we're going to show you some Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.

The kids cheer in delight.

NELSON
Cool!

MAN
We want you to tell us what you think. And, be honest, because no one from the show is here spying on you. (chuckles)

A sneezing sound comes from a large mirror on the wall.

LISA
Why is that mirror sneezing?

MAN
Ah, look, it's just an old, creaky mirror, y'know, sometimes it sounds a little like it's sneezing, or coughing, or talking softly.

LISA
Hmm...

The man gives a thumbs-up to the mirror.

MAN
Now, you each have a knob in front of you. When you like what you see, turn the knob to the right. When you don't like what you see, turn it left.

RALPH
(with knob in mouth) My knob tastes funny.

MAN
Please refrain from tasting the knob.

First up, Itchy & Scratchy play pool. Itchy knocks out Scratchy's eyeballs with a cue ball and Scratchy replaces them with two pool balls. The kids laugh turn their knobs to the right. The next cartoon is set on an island. While Itchy & Scratchy sunbathe, a muscle-bound man in bikini trunks flexes in front of the camera. Nelson turns Milhouse's knob repeatedly to the right.

MILHOUSE
Hey, quit it!

From behind the mirror, Meyers and two other people watch on a monitor.

MEYERS
They like Itchy, they like Scratchy, one kid seems to love the Speedo man... what more do they want?

Back with the focus group.

MAN
Okay, how many of you kids would like Itchy & Scratchy to deal with real-life problems, like the ones you face every day? (the kids all cheer and agree) And who would like to see them do just the opposite - getting into far-out situations involving robots and magic powers? (more cheering) So, you want a realistic, down-to-earth show... that's completely off-the-wall and swarming with magic robots? (The kids agree)

NELSON
Yeah, good.

MILHOUSE
And also, you should win things by watching!

The man sighs. The light is turned on in the observation booth, and Meyers appears at the mirror.

MEYERS
You kids don't know what you want! That's why you're still kids: 'cause you're stupid! Just tell me what's wrong with the freakin' show!

He turns the lights out. Ralph starts crying and turns his knob to the left.

RALPH
Mommy!

LISA
(talking to the mirror) Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy & Scratchy show, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had.

Meyers turns the light back on.

MEYERS
That's it. That's it, little girl! You've saved Itchy & Scratchy!

A lawyer enters the room, holding papers.

LAWYER
Please sign these papers indicating that you did not save Itchy & Scratchy.

At Itchy & Scratchy, Intl., Meyers has called a meeting of the writers (who look strikingly similar to the real Simpsons writers) along with Krusty and a female network executive.

MEYERS
I have figured out how to rejuvenate the show. It's so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it! What we need is... a new character! One that today's kids can relate to!

The writers look at each other, uncertain.

OAKLEY
Are you absolutely sure that's wise, sir? I mean, I don't want to sound pretentious here, but Itchy and Scratchy comprise a dramaturgical dyad.

KRUSTY
Hey, this ain't art, it's business! (to Meyers) Whaddya got in mind? Sexy broad? Gangster octopus?

MEYERS
No, no. The animal chain of command goes mouse, cat, dog. (to the writers) D-O-G.

WEINSTEIN
Uh, a dog? Isn't that a tad predictable?

EXECUTIVE
In your dreams. We're talking the original dog from hell.

OAKLEY
You mean Cerberus?

EXECUTIVE
(pause) We at the network want a dog with attitude. He's edgy, he's "in your face." You've heard the expression "let's get busy"? Well, this is a dog who gets "biz-zay!" Consistently and thoroughly.

KRUSTY
So he's proactive, huh?

EXECUTIVE
Oh, God, yes. We're talking about a totally outrageous paradigm.

MEYER
Excuse me, but "proactive" and "paradigm"? Aren't these just buzzwords that dumb people use to sound important? Not that I'm accusing you of anything like that. I'm fired, aren't I?

MEYERS
Oh, yes.

MEYERS
The rest of you writers start thinking up a name for this funky dog; I dunno, something along the line of say... Poochie, only more proactive.

KRUSTY
Yeah!

Meyers, Krusty and the network executive leave.

OAKLEY
So, Poochie okay with everybody?

WRITERS
Yeah...

An animator, who looks like David Silverman, draws a sketch of a dog.

MEYERS
No, no, no! He was supposed to have attitude.

SILVERMAN
Um... wh-what do you mean, exactly?

MEYERS
Oh, you know, attitude, attitude! Uh... sunglasses!

EXECUTIVE
Can we put him in more of a "hip-hop" context?

KRUSTY
Forget context, he's gotta be a surfer. Give me a nice shmear of surfer.

EXECUTIVE
I feel we should rastafy him by ... ten percent or so.

Silverman redraws Poochie. They're still not totally satisfied.

MEYERS
Hmm... I think he needs a little more attitude.

Silverman blackens in Poochie's sunglasses.

EXECUTIVE
Oh yeah, bingo. There it is, right there!

KRUSTY
Yeah, that's it!

MEYERS
I love it!

The next morning, The Simpsons eat breakfast. Bart notices the headline in the newspaper Homer is reading: "Funny Dog To Make Life Worthwhile".

BART
Hey, Lis, look! They're adding a new character to Itchy & Scratchy! Poochie the dog?!

LISA
Adding a new character is often a desperate attempt to boost low ratings.

A guy enters the kitchen.

ROY
Yo, yo! How's it hangin' everybody?

MARGE
Morning, Roy!

HOMER
Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, there having open casting for the voice of Poochie.

LISA
You should try out, Dad. You have a funny voice.

HOMER
I do not!

BART
Haven't you ever listened to yourself on a tape recorder?

HOMER
I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.

BART
(holding up a tape recorder) Well, here. Say something.

HOMER
Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying howdy to all the girls out there in radio land. (Bart plays back the tape) Ah! I don't sound like that, do I? Oh... I don't like having such a hilarious voice.

BART
That hilarious voice could be your ticket to stardom.

At the auditions. First up is Otto.

OTTO
(reading script) Whoa! A talking dog! What were you guys smokin' when you came up with that?

COHEN
We were eating rotisserie chicken. Can you just read the line, please?

OTTO
Ruff, ruff. I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!

MEYERS
You're perfect! In fact, you're better than perfect! Next to you, perfection is crap!

Troy McClure is up next.

MCCLURE
Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie, the rocking dog! Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such cartoons as "Christmas Ape" and "Christmas Ape Goes to Summer Camp".

MEYERS
You're even better than this guy! (to Otto) Take a hike, you bum.

Otto moans and walks off. Next it's Homer.

HOMER
(clears throat) Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!

MEYERS
Now, that's just bad. You've got no attitude, you're barely outrageous, and I don't know what you're in, but it's not my face. Next!

HOMER
(angrily) Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!

MEYERS
That's it! That's the Poochie attitude, do that again!

HOMER
(sheepishly) Huh? I can't, I don't remember what I did.

MEYERS
Then you don't get the job. Next!

HOMER
(sarcastically) Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well boo-hoo! I don't get to be a cartoon dog!

MEYERS
That's it, you've got the job!

HOMER
Oh, now I've got the job, huh? (realizing) Oh, thank you.



ACT TWO

Homer attends the recording session at Itchy & Scratchy studios.

SOUND GUY
Okay, Homer. Let's get a level check on your voice.

HOMER
She smells sheep smells by the sheet shtore. Wait, wait. Let me try it again.

BELLAMY
Relax Homer, you'll do fine. I'm June Bellamy. I do the voices of Itchy and Scratchy.

HOMER
You? But you're a lady!

BELLAMY
(Itchy voice) She's a lady alright. (Scratchy voice) A beauuuuuutiful lady.

HOMER
(laughing) Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?

BELLAMY
Oh, just experience I suppose. I started out as Roadrunner. (Roadrunner voice) Meep!

HOMER
You mean "meep-meep"?

BELLAMY
No, they only paid me to say it once, then they doubled it up on the soundtrack. Cheap bastards.

MEYERS
(handing them scripts) You folks ready to begin?

HOMER
Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?

BELLAMY
No, Homer. Very few cartoons are broadcast live, it's a terrible strain on the animators' wrists.

Poochie hype grips Springfield. Homer and June make an appearance at The Android's Dungeon, which is full of nerds (including Doug, Benjamin and Gary from Homer Goes To College).

DOUG
Hi. Question for Ms. Bellamy. In episode 2F09, when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a... (sniggering) magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder.

BELLAMY
Uh, well, uh...

HOMER
I'll field that one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose shirt says "Genius at Work" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?

DOUG
(embarrassed) I withdraw my question. (eats a chocolate bar)

DATABASE
Ah, excuse me Mr. Simpson. On the Itchy & Scratchy CD-ROM, is there a way to get out of the dungeon without using the wizard key?

HOMER
What the hell are you talking about?

BELLAMY
You're a lifesaver, Homer, I can't deal with these hardcore fans!

COMIC BOOK GUY
Your attention, please.

FAN
Uh, in episode...

COMIC BOOK GUY
Your attention, please! Mr. Simpson will now be autographing eight-by-ten glossies of Poochie, ONE per customer. Please form a line. There will be no cutting. I'm talking to you, Mr. Cutter.

A few minutes later, CBG cuts through the crowd.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Pardon me, look out, pardon me, excuse me, hot soup... Hi. (puts down glossies) Kindly make one out to me, and three out to my friend of the same name.

The first episode with Poochie is about to air. The Simpsons' friends and family gather in their living room.

MARGE
I'm so glad you could join us for Homer's big premiere.

BARNEY
(in the background) You know, Poochie's based on me...

JASPER
(sitting down) Is this seat taken, little girl?

BART
I'm not a girl! Are you blind?

JASPER
Yes.

ROY
I am stoked, Mr. S.

MARGE
Shh! Everybody it's coming on!

Krusty appears on-screen, lit by a dim spotlight. Slides appear behind him.

KRUSTY
Once in a great while, we are privileged to experience a television event so extraordinary, it becomes part of our shared heritage. (slide of an astronaut on the moon) 1969 - Man walks on the moon. (slide of astronaut playing golf on the moon) 1971 - Man walks on the moon... again. (no slide) Then, for a long time, nothing happened. Until tonight. Behold the future of Comedy: Poochie!!

The audience cheer and the cartoon starts, with altered theme music. Poochie's voice:

THEME
(high voice) They fight, and bite... (low voice) and bark. (high voice) They fight they fight and bite... (low voice) and bark. (high voice) Fight fight fight (low voice) Woof woof woof. (high voice) The Itchy and Scratchy... and Poochie show!

The episode is titled "The Beagle Has Landed." Itchy & Scratchy are driving together. They pass signs reading "Fireworks Factory 2 Miles", "Fireworks Factory 1 Mile", then "Fireworks Factory ½ Mile". They then spot Poochie at the side of the road.

ITCHY
Look, Scratchy, it's our new friend, Poochie.

SCRATCHY
What's that name again? I forgot.

POOCHIE
(rapping) The name's Poochie D, And I rock the telly, I'm half Joe Camel, And a third Fonzarelli. I'm the kung fu hippie, From gangsta city, I'm a rappin' surfer, You the fool I pity.

SCRATCHY
Ooh, Poochie is one outrageous dude.

ITCHY
He's totally in my face.

POOCHIE
(playing guitar) Wiggity wiggity, Word up? Rock on party!

MILHOUSE
When are they going to get to the fireworks factory? (crying)

MOE
Can somebody tell me what the hell is going on? Midge, help me out here.

HOMER
Quiet! You're missing the jokes!

Poochie dribbles a basketball while riding a bike, slam dunks it and lands in Itchy & Scratchy's car.

POOCHIE
Catch you on the flip side, dudemeisters. (holds out hand for high five, Scratchy extends his arm and Poochie withdraws his) Not!! (Homer's normal voice) Hey kids, always recycle... (as Poochie) to the extreme!! Bust it!

Poochie drives off in Itchy & Scratchy's car. An awkward silence follows in The Simpsons' living room.

NELSON
Ah, that stunk!

HOMER
So, what did everybody think?

Nobody answers and they start leaving.

NED
Homer, I can honestly say that was the best episode of Impy & Chimpy I've ever seen!

CARL
Yeah, you should be very proud, Homer, you, uh... got a beautiful home here.

Nelson punches Bart on his way out.

HOMER
So, it was pretty okay, huh?

BART
Mom, can we go to bed without dinner?

MARGE
Yes we can. (They rush upstairs)

HOMER
Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I? (pan up to brain)

BRAIN
Oh, you don't want to know what I really think. Now look sad and say "D'oh".

HOMER
D'oh...



ACT THREE

The next morning at breakfast.

HOMER
I'm the worst Poochie ever.

LISA
Ah, it's not your fault, dad. You did fine. It's just that Poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking. You can't be cool just by spouting off a bunch of worn-out buzzwords.

BART
Don't have a cow, Lis.

MARGE
Bart's right. Let's none of us have a cow. All that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.

In the Android's Dungeon...

COMIC BOOK GUY
Last night's Itchy & Scratchy was, without a doubt, the worst episode ever! Rest assured that I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.

BART
Hey, I know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?

COMIC BOOK GUY
As a loyal viewer, I feel they owe me.

BART
What? They're giving you thousands of hours of entertainment for free. What could they possibly owe you? I mean, If anything, you owe them.

COMIC BOOK GUY
(pause) Worst episode ever.

Kent Brockman delivers the news.

KENT BROCKMAN
It looks like the end of the venerable Itchy and Scratchy program. For years, TV critics, such as yours truly, Kent Brockman, have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade. Yesterday, our prays were finally answered when Poochie the Dog made his howlingly unfunny debut. Far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall, but I have a feeling that no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep.

Krusty and the writers are watching the report.

KRUSTY
What the hell happened?!

EXECUTIVE
Well, I'd attribute the product failure to fundamental shifts in our key demographic, coupled with the overall crumminess of Poochie.

KRUSTY
(crying hysterically) You've got to stop this thing. Please, I'm getting egged on the street. Do something! Do something!!

Homer enters.

HOMER
Uh, hi, Mr. Meyers. I've been doing some thinking, and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here. (pulls out a piece of paper) One, Poochie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine. Two, whenever Poochie's not onscreen, all the other characters should be asking "Where's Poochie"? Three--

MEYERS
Great, great. Just leave them right there on the floor on your way out.

Homer does so, but realizes something's wrong. He eavesdrops on the meeting from a closet next door.

MEYERS
Listen guys, we've got to do something about Poochie.

KRUSTY
There's only one thing we can do.

Homer hears something and is shocked. At dinner, Homer tells his family what he heard.

HOMER
Then they said they were going to kill Poochie off!

BART
(joyful) Really?! (realizing) Oh, how terrible.

LISA
(trance-like) Yes. Terrible.

MARGE
It's not your fault, Homer. It's those lousy writers. They make me madder than a... um... yak in heat!

HOMER
You're right Marge. it's not my fault. I won't let them treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy.

ROY
Right on, Mr. S!

HOMER
Put a sock in it, Roy.

At the recording studio.

MEYERS
Okay. So here is where Itchy lunges at Poochie with a rusty chainsaw. Cue sound effects. (Sound guy makes chainsaw sound) Rustier! (rustier chainsaw sound)

BELLAMY
(as Itchy) Are you prepared to die, Poochie?

HOMER
No, I am not.

MEYERS
Oh, cut, cut, cut, cut! You'll stick to the script as its written, Homer. You're supposed to say "Please, cut off my head. I don't deserve to live."

HOMER
Never! (He tears he script in half,the writers gasp) You can't just kill of a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries. But first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm going to read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.

MEYERS
Forget it Homer. We can do this show without you, if we have to.

BELLAMY
But not without me!

MEYERS
Oh, jeez!

BELLAMY
Let him try the new lines.

MEYERS
Alright. Alright. We'll try them. Action.

BELLAMY
(as Itchy) Hi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?

HOMER
(as Poochie) Yes, I certainly do! (normal voice) Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away. I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog that nobody wanted, I know we can make them laugh and cry until we grow old together.

MEYERS
(impressed) ...and cut!

June claps. Then slowly everyone else begins to clap.

Back at home, the new episode is about to air.

HOMER
Now kids, I know you loved the old Poochie, but the new one is going to be better than ten Super Bowls! I don't want to oversell it, judge for yourself.

At an ice sculpture contest, Itchy begins cutting into Scratchy with a chainsaw. Suddenly, Poochie wanders by.

SCRATCHY
Hey, looks who's here.

ITCHY
Hi, Poochie. You look like you've got something to say. Do you?

POOCHIE
Yes, I certainly do! (Poochie's mouth stops moving and Meyers' voice is heard) I have to go now. My planet needs me.

The whole cel with Poochie on it is moved upwards. A screen shows some handwritten text: "Note: Poochie died on the way back to his home planet".

BART
Wow, Poochie came from another planet?

LISA
Uh, I guess...

HOMER
Hey that wasn't supposed to happen. Those finks double-crossed me.

KRUSTY
Poochie's dead! (laughs) (kids in audience cheer) Well kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die, they're back again the very next week. That's why I'm presenting this sworn affidavit that Poochie will never, ever, ever return!

LAWYER
This document conforms to all applicable laws and statutes.

BART & LISA
Yeah! ...oh.

BART
Tough break, Dad. I guess people just weren't ready for Poochie. Maybe in a few years.

ROY
Good news, everybody. I'm moving into my own apartment with two sexy ladies.

MARGE
Oh, then I guess this is goodbye, Roy. Maybe we'll see you in a few years. (she kisses him, and he leaves)

HOMER
Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live learn.

Later, Bart & Lisa watch an Itchy & Scratchy episode, back in its original form. Itchy & Scratchy are doing a William Tell act. Itchy shoots a bow and arrow at Scratchy, and it hits the apple on Scratchy's head. He is relieved, but then realizes that the arrow pierced a tank of Carbolic Acid, which leaks out and dissolves Scratchy's flesh. Bart & Lisa laugh.

BART
It's back to the basics, classic "Itchy & Scratchy."

LISA
We should thank our lucky stars that they're still putting on a program of this caliber after so many years.

They both stare blankly for a few seconds.

BART
What else is on?

Lisa changes the channel, screen goes to static and the credits roll.



#### SET 12 ####
ACT ONE

The Simpsons watch TV. A commercial comes on. A man barbeques a soccer ball, and throws it towards the camera.

MAN
Open wide for some soccer!

Several soccer clips follow, with a voice over.

TV ANNOUNCER
The Continental Soccer Association is coming to Springfield! It's all here - fast-kicking, low scoring, and ties? You bet!

BART
Hey Dad, how come you've never taken us to see a soccer game?

HOMER
I... don't know.

TV ANNOUNCER
You'll see all your favorite soccer stars. Like Adiaga! Adiaga two! Badiaga! Aruglia! And Pizzoza!

HOMER
Oh, I've never heard of those people.

TV ANNOUNCER
And they'll all be signing autographs.

HOMER
Woohoo!

TV ANNOUNCER
This match will determine once and for all which nation is the greatest on earth - Mexico or Portugal!

BART & LISA
Can we go Dad, please Dad, Please Dad, can we go Dad, huh, huh, please?

HOMER
Yes, yes! Oh god, yes!!

The Simpsons arrive at the soccer stadium.

HOMER
Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.

MARGE
It's hard to believe this used to be an internment camp.

BART
Yo, Paella man! Wing one up here!

The man throws him a bowl of paella, and Bart manages to catch it. Lisa notices Pele walking onto the pitch

LISA
Hey look! It's Pele!

PELE
Pele is king of the soccer field. To be king of your kitchen, use Crestfield wax paper.

He is handed a bag of money and walks off. The game starts, and the crowd cheers. The Mexican team kicks off, and pass it between them, again and again... and again... The crowd becomes quiet.

HOMER
Boring!

KRUSTY
Come on, you schnorrers, do something!

KENT BROCKMAN
(in a commentary booth, bored) Half back passes to the center, back to the wing, back to the center. Center holds it. Holds it. Holds it...

MEXICAN COMMENTATOR
(excitedly) Half back passes to center, back to wing, back to center! Center holds it! Holds it! Holds it!!

SIDESHOW MEL
I can't bear this any longer, I'm leaving.

MOE
Hey, not before me you ain't.

FLANDERS
Now, now, there's plenty of exits for everyone.

MOE
Oh, that's it, you're dead, pal!

SKINNER
Hey now, that's uncalled for.

LENNY
Shut your hole, Skinner!

He punches Skinner, knocking him into Barney, spilling his beer. Barney gets mad, and dives headfirst into the people fighting, knocking them over. Groundskeeper Willy and his friends watch from nearby.

WILLY
Ach! You call this a soccer riot? Come on, boys, let's take 'em to school!

The Scots join the fighting, and the riot escalates.

MARGE
Homer, we've got to get out of here!

HOMER
But I wanna do some rioting! (he pushes one of the Scotsmen)

SCOTSMAN
Jobbers cognots, ya mucker!

HOMER
All done!

The family run off. Outside, the whole town has engaged in the riot.

The Simpsons watch the TV news.

KENT BROCKMAN
What began as a traditional soccer riot, has escalated into a city-wide orgy of destruction. (He ducks to avoid something being thrown at him.) Reacting swiftly, Mayor Quimby has declared "mob rule", so, for the next several years, it's every family for itself.

Snake walks out of Ned Flanders' house with a television set.

FLANDERS
Excuse me sir, I think you've got my TV. Sir!

LISA
Somebody's got to stop them!

BART
Let's wait until they burn the school down!

MARGE
Oh my god! Homer, they're right next door!

HOMER
Relax, Marge, if someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.

Homer indicates a contraption by the front door. A fishing line attached to the door holds an alarm clock above a goldfish bowl. Somebody tries the door handle. Marge gasps.

HOMER
(relaxed) Watch the fish, Marge.

A hand reaches through the mail slot and grabs the fish.

MARGE
D'oh...

Homer decides to get some better security. He calls out a man from "Ex-Con Security".

SALESMAN
Looks like you called me just in time. (He pockets several things from the living room.) This home isn't secure at all.

HOMER
What did I tell ya, Marge?

SALESMAN
Intruders could come down the chimney, through the mail slot, even hidden in your groceries. Did you change the locks when you moved in? I thought not. All the previous owners of this house could still be in here somewhere.

MARGE
What do you recommend?

SALESMAN
Well, a lot of companies would put in a pretty system that looks good, but doesn't provide any real protection.

HOMER
Oh, let's get that.

SALESMAN
...But if you want to sleep easy at night, I recommend sealing off every door and window with bullet-proof Lucite.

MARGE
Wouldn't we all suffocate?

SALESMAN
(laughing) Well, I should hope not.

HOMER
Let's get that - the suffocation thing.

SALESMAN
And you can have it all for only five hundred dollars.

HOMER
Five hundred dollars? Aw, forget it.

He pushes the salesman to the door.

SALESMAN
But surely, you can't put a price on your family's lives?

HOMER
I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.

MARGE
Homer, we need something to prtect this family.

HOMER
I couldn't agree more Marjory. You deserve piece of mind, and piece of mind is what you shall have.

Cut to a gun store.

HOMER
I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.

CLERK
Aisle six, next to the "sympathy" cards.



ACT TWO

Homer is looking at the guns. He picks up an unloaded handgun, points it at the clerk, and pulls the trigger several times.

CLERK
Whoa! Careful there, Annie Oakley.

HOMER
I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.

The clerk takes the gun, then holds up several items in succession.

CLERK
Well, you'll probably want the accessory kit. Holster...

HOMER
Oh, yeah.

CLERK
Bandoleer.

HOMER
Baby.

CLERK
Silencer.

HOMER
Mm-hmm.

CLERK
Loudener.

HOMER
Oh...

CLERK
Speed-cocker.

HOMER
Ooh, I like the sound of that!

CLERK
(holding up a huge weapon) And this is for shooting down police helicopters.

HOMER
Oh, I don't need anything like that... yet... Just give me my gun.

He tries to take the gun.

CLERK
I'm sorry, but the law requires a five-day waiting period. We've got to run a background check.

HOMER
Five days? But I'm mad now! I'd kill you if I had my gun.

CLERK
Yeah, well you don't.

Homer walks out of the store, muttering.

HOMER
Lousy big shot, thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns, well if he didn't have any guns I'd show him a thing or two. (At home that night, he is still muttering , as he paces up and down the hallway.) Let's see him walk into my store and then we'll see who's worried about five-day waiting periods...

LISA
Dad, it's three a.m. Can't you mutter in your room?

HOMER
Marge kicked me out.

LISA
(groaning) Oh... all right, go ahead.

HOMER
(still muttering) Pushy kids, think they can tell me what to do in my house, well I tell you, parents these days, they don't know how to rear children...

The next morning, Homer sits out on the lawn in a deck chair.

HOMER
Oh, how am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?

He watches as a "Target Superstores" van, a line of ducks, a line of rabbits, Patty & Selma on a bicycle and Ned Flanders on his ride-on mower pass him. Flanders passes twice.

Soon, the five days has passed. Homer waits impatiently outside the gun store.

HOMER
Come on, come on, open up!

The gun salesman opens the shop, and Homer rushes inside to go to the toilet.

HOMER
Ah! That's the stuff! (He comes back out into the store.) Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.

CLERK
(picking up a large wad of paper) Well, let's see here. According to your background check, you've been in a mental institution...

HOMER
Yeah.

CLERK
Frequent problems with alcohol...

HOMER
Oh heh heh, yeah.

CLERK
You beat up President Bush!

HOMER
Former President.

The clerk stamps the paper.

HOMER
"Potentially dangerous"?

CLERK
Relax, that just limits you to three handguns or less.

HOMER
Woo hoo!

Homer arrives back home.

HOMER
Close your eyes, Marge, I have a surprise for you!

MARGE
Oh!

HOMER
Okay, open you're eyes!

We see Marge's perspective as she opens her eyes to see Homer pointing the gun straight at her.

MARGE
Aaah!

HOMER
It's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger, and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die--

MARGE
Homer, I don't want guns in my house. Don't you remember when Maggie shot Mr. Burns?

HOMER
I thought Smithers did it.

LISA
That would have made a lot more sense...

BART
Hey Dad, can I borrow the gun tomorrow? I want to scare that old security guard at the bank.

HOMER
Only if you clean your room.

MARGE
No! No one's using this gun! The TV said you're fifty-eight percent more likely to shoot a family member than an intruder!

HOMER
TV said that? But I have to have a gun! It's in the Constitution!

LISA
Dad! The Second Amendment is just a remnant from revolutionary days. It has no meaning today!

HOMER
You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants, and start shoving you around. (he starts pushing Lisa) Do you want that? Huh? Do you?

LISA
No...

HOMER
All right then.

He reaches for the gun.

MARGE
I'm sorry, Homer. No weapons.

HOMER
A gun is not a weapon, Marge, it's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon, or, uh... or an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what - you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.

Homer and Marge arrive at the NRA meeting. Lou and Eddie security check everyone. Several people walk through a metal detector, making it beep. When Kearney walks through the metal detector and it doesn't beep, he is sent back to get a gun. Inside, Lenny stands at the podium, holding a gun.

LENNY
Assault weapons have gotten a lot of bad press lately, but they're manufactured for a reason: to take out today's modern super animals, such as the flying squirrel, and the electric eel.

HOMER
Learning something, Marge?

MARGE
Hmm...

Moe approaches the podium.

MOE
Uh, hi, I'm Moe S.

CROWD
Hi, Moe.

MOE
Yeah, so last night I was closing up the bar, when some young punk comes in and tries to stick me up.

The crowd gasps.

SIDESHOW MEL
Whatever did you do, Moe?

MOE
Well, it coulda been a real ugly situation, but I managed to shoot him in the spine. (crowd applaud) Yeah, I guess the next place he robs better have a ramp! Ha ha!

The crowd laugh. Homer stands up.

HOMER
Hi, I'm Homer S.

CROWD
Hi, Homer.

HOMER
Hi. It seems to me, if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization.

The crowd cheers. Marge grabs Homer and pulls him towards her.

MARGE
Homer, you can't join up with these gun nuts!

HOMER
Aw, come on, be fair Marge! For once in your life, be fair!

MARGE
Oh...

Homer is at a firing range. He shoots several cans on a wall. Lenny points out the targets on the wall to his right. It turns out he was shooting at the snack counter.

HOMER
Sorry!

TEENAGER
My fault!

Later, Homer walks into the Kwik-E-Mart, twirling his gun on his finger.

APU
Oh! Don't shoot! Just take the money and get out!

HOMER
What? Oh, Apu, I would never...

The shot pans up to his brain.

HOMER'S BRAIN
Or would I? I've already gone this far. I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart?

Homer imagines himself sat on a rocking chair outside a mansion, wearing a suit and a monocle. Marge dances in a bikini next to him. Fade back to reality.

HOMER
I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart! All right, put your--

Homer is driving away from the store, with a sandwich in his hand.

HOMER
D'oh! Oh well, I'll rob it next time.

Homer arrives home.

LISA
Dad, can you help me get my ball down from the roof, Dad?

HOMER
Sure thing, honey.

He fires his pistol at the roof, and a ball drops down, then deflates.

HOMER
Want me to get the cat down?

LISA
(quickly) No thanks!

Soon in the backyard, Homer practices shooting. Bart throws several plates into the air for Homer to fire at.

HOMER
Pull!

Homer fires several shots. All hit except for the last one.

BART
You missed one, Dad.

HOMER
See you in Hell, dinner plate!

He shoots the plate on the ground. Later again, the family eat dinner out of baking trays and colanders.

MARGE
Does anyone know where all my dinner plates went?

BART
Um...

HOMER
Mmm... you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get together?

Homer indicates himself with his gun.

MARGE
Homer, I told you this morning, no guns at the dinner table!

HOMER
You said the breakfast table!

MARGE
It's the same table!!

HOMER
Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on. (he flicks the safety, but the gun still fires) Whoops. Guess it was already on. (he flicks it again, and the gun fires again) Uh, I'd... better just put it down...

He lays it on the table. Suddenly it fires by itself, and hits a knife. The knife flies through the air and hits a picture of Marge on the wall. The family stare in disbelief.

LISA
No offense, Mom, but that was pretty cool.

MARGE
Homer, I think you'd agree I've had to put up with a lot in this marriage--

Homer opens his mouth to protest, but sees the kids shaking their heads at him.

MARGE
--but this is the first time since we've been married that I've actually feared for our lives. So I'm asking you, if you really care about me and the children, please, please get rid of the gun.

HOMER
All right, Marge, I'll do it. For you.

MARGE
(hugging him) I'm a lucky woman.

HOMER
And I'm a wonderful man.

Bart and Milhouse play. Bart is reaching up into the freezer to find something.

BART
Aw, I don't feel them.

MILHOUSE
You said there'd be fudgicles, Bart. Where's the fudgicles?

BART
First, it's fudgesicle. And I know they're up here. I just need a better foothold. (he opens the vegetable crisper and sees Homer's gun) Hello!

Bart points a gun at Milhouse, who has an apple in his mouth.

BART
And the next marksman is... William Tell Junior!

MILHOUSE
Jinx!

Marge and Homer walk in.

MARGE
Bart!

HOMER
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.

MARGE
You lied to me! You promised to get rid of this gun!

HOMER
I put it in a safe place, Marge! I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?

MARGE
How could you? Of all the terrible things you've ever done in your life, this is the worst, the most despicable!

HOMER
But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!

MARGE
Mmm... Until you decide what's more important, your gun, or your family, we can't live in the same house. Come on, kids.

HOMER
So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go. I'll be just fine. (aside, to Milhouse) Do you know how to cook dinner?

MILHOUSE
Do I?!

He opens a cupboard and pulls pots and pans out.



ACT THREE

Marge and the kids arrive at Spinster City Apartments, where Patty & Selma reside. Selma answers.

MARGE
I've left Homer!

SELMA
Thank God.

MARGE
So we need a place to spend the night.

SELMA
Try the Sleep-Eazy motel. I woke up there once. It seemed nice.

MARGE
Why can't we stay here?

SELMA
Uh, we have a gentleman caller.

TV REPAIR MAN
Hey, this TV's not broken, it's just unplugged. What the--

The door slams shut.

Back at home, Homer prepares for his NRA meeting.

HOMER
Ooh, the gun club's gonna be here any minute! (the doorbell rings) Oh! They're here. They're here!

MOE
Hiya, Homer. I brung ya a big bag of irregular Oreos. (picks one) I don't see what's wrong with this one. (eats it) Oh.

Marge and the kids arrive at the Sleep-Eazy motel. Some of the letters on the neon sign burn out, leaving "Sleazy motel" lit up. They walk past some prostitutes.

PROSTITUTE
Looking for a good time, sailor?

BART
I certainly am!

MARGE
(drags him inside) No you're not! (puts her head back round the door) He's really not.

Back at the NRA meeting.

MOE
And that's how, with a few minor adjustments, you can turn a regular gun into five guns.

HOMER
Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.

Homer holds a can of beer, and shoots the top off, opening it.

HOMER
Anyone else want a beer?

DR. HIBBERT
Homer! You use your gun as a can opener?

HOMER
I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.

Homer fires several shots at the TV. When he eventually turns it on, the picture simulates a man having just been shot.

AGNES SKINNER
I've never seen such recklessness!

LOUIE
You mighta hurt someone!

CLETUS
Are you some kind of moron?

HOMER
Yeah, but--

KRUSTY
Hey, yutz! Guns aren't toys. They're for family protection, hunting dangerous or delicious animals, and keeping the King of England out of your face.

MOE
Your membership card, please, Homer. (he tears up Homer's card)

HOMER
Oh...

MOE
I'll also need to remove your tattoo (holds up a cheese grater)

HOMER
I didn't get one yet!

MOE
Rats.

DR. HIBBERT
Now, since you're no longer a member, please go outside until the meeting is over. (he chuckles)

Marge and the kids try to find their room at the motel. They pass a pool.

BART
Hey, we got a pool!

LISA
Can we go swimming, Mom?

A man is fishing a dead body out of the pool.

MARGE
Not right now, dear.

They enter the room.

BART
Wow! The TV's coin operated!

LISA
And so is the Bible!

It shuts on her. Bart picks up the phone.

BART
I'd like to order a wake up call please. Three a.m. For every room except this one. That's right. Goodnight! (he puts the phone down, and chuckles) Always love trying out new material on the road.

As Marge stares out of the window in despondency, Bart and Lisa race vibrating beds.

BART
No way are you gonna beat me, this time, Lis.

LISA
(voice shaking) Yes I am! Come on, spotty!

BART
(voice shaking) Come on, smelly!

Back at home, Homer turns all the lights off by shooting the bulbs out.

HOMER
Oh, this gun cost me everything - my wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun. (he shoots out the last light) This stinks. I want my family back!

At the motel, the kids are in bed.

BART
Hey, is that a camera in the ceiling?

VOICE
No. Go back to sleep.

LISA
Mom! This bed is making me nauseous! Why won't it stop?

MARGE
Honey, it'll be morning soon, try to get some sleep.

The door suddenly opens. Marge holds up a piece of wood to defend herself. Mayor Quimby and a woman stand at the door.

QUIMBY
Oh, uh, I'm sorry. Are you planning to stay the whole night?

MARGE
Yes!

QUIMBY
All right. (starts to leave) Vote Quimby!

Homer arrives at the motel. He checks several rooms.

HOMER
Marge? (a man grumbles) Sorry. Marge? (a woman screams) Sorry. Marge?

QUIMBY
Vote Quimby.

HOMER
Sorry.

Marge calls to him from the other end of the motel.

MARGE
Homer!

HOMER
Oh, Marge! There's so many things I wanna yell to you!

MARGE
Come down here!!

HOMER
Okay!!

They talk in the motel room.

HOMER
Oh, honey, please come home. I need you! It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome, and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks!

MARGE
What about the gun?

HOMER
It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection, if you've got no one to protect?

MARGE
Oh, Homie... (they hug) Come on, kids, we're going home!

The kids roll past on the vibrating bed.

BART & LISA
Yay!

The family are at the reception desk. Mayor Quimby gets some ice from the dispenser.

MOTEL CLERK
Okey-doke, here's your bill, and your continental breakfast.

He puts a fried egg into an envelope, and hands it to them. Suddenly, Snake bursts into the room and holds a knife to Mayor Quimby's neck.

SNAKE
All right, everybody, hands up! (indicating the clerk) You, give me the cash draw.

QUIMBY
Do what he says, I'm too rich to die!

Homer pulls out his gun.

HOMER
Freeze, bad guy!

Snake drops the knife and Mayor Quimby runs out.

QUIMBY
Vote Quimby!

SNAKE
Okay, man. Don't shoot, chill.

MARGE
Homer! You said you got rid of the gun! You lied to me - again!

HOMER
I know I said that. But what I secretly meant was--

SNAKE
(grabbing the gun) Yoink! Ho ho! Ha ha ha!

HOMER
The jokes on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing. (he hold up a box) Ha ha!

SNAKE
Yo! Give me the bullets!

HOMER
Okay, don't shoot!

He hands Snake the box. Just then, Moe, Agnes, Lenny, and Dr. Hibbert appear in the doorway, pointing guns at Snake.

ALL
Drop it!

Snake drops the gun, grabs some money off the clerk and runs off.

SNAKE
Bye!

MARGE
How did you know we were being robbed?

LENNY
The clerk here pressed the silent alarm and we picked it up on our scanners.

LISA
Did anybody stop that robber?

MOE
No, I don't think so.

Homer picks up the gun.

HOMER
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!

Marge takes the gun, and Homer and the kids leave. Marge steps on the pedal of a trash can, but seeing her reflection in the lid, decides she looks cool with the gun. She puts it in her purse and walks out, closing the door behind her.


#### SET 13 ####
ACT ONE

A storm rages on a dark cloudy sky and Noah, played by Troy McClure, waits for God to command him.

GOD
Noah! They shalt builts thyself an ark, measuring 300 cubits in length!

MCCLURE
(writing on a stone tablet) 300 cubits... give or take.

GOD
Exactly 300! And thou shalt taketh two of every creature!

MCCLURE
(writing it down) Two creatures.

GOD
Two of EVERY creature!

MCCLURE
Even stink beetles?

GOD
ESPECIALLY stink beetles!

In the Simpson living room, the family are watching this great film.

BART
Whoa, cool, God is so in your face!

HOMER
Yeah, he's my favorite fictional character.

Marge notices the time.

MARGE
Oh, it's so late! You kids have to go to bed!

BART
But the flood's only knee-high! At least let us watch 'til the midgets drown!

LISA
Yeah, mom, c'mon! You let us stay up to watch Troy McClure in such other bible epics as David vs. Super-Goliath and Suddenly Last Supper!

BART
Go Lis! Way to cite precedent!

Bart and Lisa high five.

MARGE
Oh, alright, you can stay up late tonight, but tomorrow everyone's going to bed at 5 o'clock!

HOMER
Woo hoo!

The family attentively watches the TV. Cut to everyone dreary-eyed as they watch the end of the movie, which ends with a rainbow emerging from dark clouds.

LISA
(weary) Aw, those poor badgers are soaked.

HOMER
Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.

GOD
Go forth, Noah! And remember! The key to salvation is--

Suddenly, the screen splits and Kent Brockman reports.

KENT
You've seen the movie, now meet a real-life Noah! Only this Noah has been accused of KILLING two of every animal! Coming up next on A.M. Springfield!

Forcing herself to awareness, Marge notices the time. Maggie is sleeping across Marge's lap.

MARGE
Ooh, my goodness! That was a long movie. It's time for school. Let's go! Let's go!

Bart and Lisa trudge through the kitchen. Homer makes a phone call.

HOMER
Ah, can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers! I have smallpox! ...Well, it wasn't wiped out in MY house!

A Model UN Club meeting is in progress at Springfield elementary.

SKINNER
Ok, delegates, you leave tomorrow for the statewide Model U.N., so this is out last chance to bone up. And bone we will!

All of the kids break into laughter, except Lisa.

BART
(to Lisa) Lighten up, Lis.

SKINNER
(to Martin) Finland, let's see that naitve dance.

Martin starts dancing Lappish style.

SKINNER
Smile more. Work that pelvis. No, too much smile. Sit down. (to Milhouse) Poland! Tell us about your nation's achievements!

MILHOUSE
Well, uh, I heard they sent a rocket to the sun once... at night... And there was that submarine, with the screen doors...

SKINNER
No, no, no, no, no, young man, you need to do some SERIOUS boning!

This time only Lisa laughs.

BART
Oh, grow up, Lis.

SKINNER
(to Bart) OK, Libya... exports!

BART
Yes, sir, you American pig!

SKINNER
(chuckles) Nice touch.

BART
Uh, ahem, let's see...

Bart shuffles his blank papers, pretending to find something.

BART
The exports of Libya are numerous in amount. One thing they export is corn, or as the Indians call it, "maize". Another famous Indian was "Crazy Horse". In conclusion, Libya is a land of contrast. Thank you.

A commotion interrupts Skinner before he can comment on Bart's performance. Nelson, the Japanese delegate, pinches Wendell's nose with chopsticks.

WENDELL
Oww, I can't breath! Please stop him!

SKINNER
I'd like to, but I'm afraid he has diplomatic immunity.

LISA
Point of order, if we want to learn anything we must respec--

BART
Point of odor, Lisa stinks.

All the kids laugh.

SHERRI
(to Bart) Hey. Leave her alone!

NELSON
(to Sherri) You leave her alone!

All the kids start fighting with each other, with one exception. Ralph, the Canadian delegate, stands.

RALPH
(singing) Oh, Canada!

Skinner bangs his shoe on the table.

SKINNER
Order, order! Do you kids wanna be like the real U.N., or do you just wanna squabble and waste time?

The next day, the kids board the bus.

MARGE
Have a great weekend, kids. Be nice to the underprivileged countries.

WIGGUM
Good luck, Ralphie. If your nose starts bleeding it means you're picking it too much... or not enough.

Skinner makes an announcement after everyone is aboard the bus.

SKINNER
Ok, kids, Otto's in charge. (quietly to Otto) Remember, Otto. We're trusting you with our greatest natural resource... the school bus.

Back at home, Homer checks his mail out by the mailbox.

HOMER
Water bill, third notice. Jury duty, third notice. Mortgage bill.. ooh, second notice!

Homer drops the bill down the storm drain.

HOMER
Flancrest Enterprises?

Flanders overhears Homer since he is out by his mailbox.

NED
Oops! That's for me! Flancrest Enterprises is my home business.

HOMER
You liar! You don't have a home business, why would you make up a lie like that?

NED
No, it's true! Maude and I sell religious book rugs over the Internet!

HOMER
(smooth) Internet, eh?

NED
Yes, indeedy! Making some good scratch, too!

HOMER
(smooth) Scratch, eh?

NED
Yep!

HOMER
(smooth) Maude, eh?

Back in the Simpson dining room, Homer sets up his new home business. He makes sure to bring all the essentials to his "desk": typewriter, a drinking bird toy, some office supplies and the family portrait he takes from the wall.

MARGE
Homer, what are you doing?

HOMER
No time to answer that, Marge. I'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise.

MARGE
What business enterprise?

HOMER
Ever hear of a little thing called the Internet?

MARGE
Internet, eh?

HOMER
Oh yeah. Everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. WAY behind.

Marge takes notice of Homer's pencil holder, the butter and butter dish.

MARGE
Is that my good butter?

HOMER
Can't discuss that now, Marge! I have to write another delicious memo!

Homer takes a pencil from the butter and licks it.

HOMER
Mmm... memo.

Otto's driving while he hears kids singing.

KIDS
Sixty three bottles of beer on the wall, sixty three bottles of beer...

OTTO
Oh, this song is driving me crazy.

Otto fast forwards his cassette tape, and we see the kids on the bus are silent.

KIDS
B-I-N-G-O and bingo was his name-o!

OTTO
Man, I don't know why I bought this stupid tape!

Otto takes removes a cassette titled "Songs to Annoy Bus Drivers" and tosses it out the window. Pan to Bart and Nelson at the very back of the bus. Nelson opens the cooler with food. Nelson pulls out an orange.

NELSON
Hey Simpson. Race ya.

Bart reaches in and grabs an apple.

BART
First one to the front of the bus gets Martin's lunch money.

MARTIN
What?!

Nelson and Bart roll their fruit up the bus aisle.

BART
Go apple!

NELSON
Go orange!

Ralph lays a banana in the aisle.

RALPH
Go Banana!

Ralph has a very disappointed look on his face as his banana doesn't roll. The kids cheer on the fruit. Milhouse grabs a grapefruit from the cooler.

MILHOUSE
Make way for grapefruit. Go grapefruit.

Milhouse rolls the grapefruit pass all the other fruit and it lands wedged behind the brake pedal. The bus passes a "SLOW. BRIDGE AHEAD." sign. Being a good driver, Otto attempts to press the brake pedal, but the grapefruit prevents any such action.

OTTO
Uh! What the?!

Otto slam his foot on the pedal squishing the grapefruit and getting juice in his eyes.

OTTO
It burns! I can't see!

Otto drives the bus with his eyes close, bouncing off both guardrails. The kids get flopped all over the bus and panic.

OTTO
Stay calm, kids. I need you to be my eyes.

The bus drives through a guardrail now, and starts falling.

OTTO
Ok, which way should I turn?



ACT TWO

Seagulls fly by over a calm ocean setting. We hear screaming as the bus falls into the water. The screaming stops. A lone seagull flies by. The bus then floats to the surface. Kids scream. Wendell looks like he's going to puke.

RALPH
(watching his banana) Go banana.

Otto struggles with the steering wheel.

OTTO
Just hang tight kids. I'll swim for help.

Otto swims out the bus window into open sea. The tide pulls him backwards.

OTTO
What the?! Zeppelin rules!

Otto floats out to the horizon. Kids continue to moan as the water level in the bus quickly rises.

BART
I guess this is the end, Wendell.

LEWIS
He's Wendell! (points to Wendell) I'm Lewis!

BART
Well, whatever, just tell Wendell I said bye.

The bus gets slammed against a rock, scraping a gash in the side. This lets in more water, but the kids get washed out of the bus. Milhouse flails.

MILHOUSE
Somebody help me! I think I'm getting swimmer's ear!

Bart swims to help Milhouse, and the bus sinks under the water as the kids watch. The bus makes the "beeping" associated when a big vehicle backs up. The kids swim to the shore of a nearby island. The kids sit on the sand, most of them crying.

SHERRI
This is all Lisa's fault, she started the stupid U.N. club!

LISA
Hey! Martin seconded the motion, it's entirely his fault.

NELSON
People, people! Let's not blame each other! We all know this is Milhouse's fault!

MILHOUSE
Huh?

SHERRI
Yeah, you and your stupid grapefruit almost got us killed!

All the kids argue between themselves, until they hear a horn sound. Bart stand atop a rock with a conch shell in his hand.

BART
What's everyone's problem? I'm glad we're stranded! It'll be just like the Swiss Family Robinson, only with more cursing! We're gonna live like kings! Damn, hell, ass kings!

As "Under the Sea" plays, a fantasy sequence is imagined with the kids living in a wonderful tree settlement. Martin takes a shower. Wendell uses a water slide. Sherri and Terri drive a bamboo and grass car. Ralph pigs out on food and a monkey butler brings Nelson a drink. Back to reality.

BART
And every night the monkey butlers will regale us with jungle stories.

NELSON
How many monkey butlers will there be?

BART
One at first. But he'll train others.

All the kids marvel at such a great future. Bart climbs down from the rock.

BART
Good, let's get to work! Me and Nelson will build the treehouse. Martin, draw up plans for a coconut radio, and if possible, a coconut Nintendo system.

LISA
What about the rest of us?

BART
You guys gather food for the big feast tonight! And maybe a little wine for the older kids.

NELSON
Delicious wine?

BART
Exactly.

Back in the new Simpsons' home office.

HOMER
Oh, what am I gonna call my Internet company? All the good names are taken. Oh wait, I've got it! Flancrest Enterprises! (looks in a book) D'oh!

MARGE
What exactly is it your company does again?

HOMER
This industry moves so fast it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting-edge, like CutCo, EdgeCom, InterSlice... come on, Marge, you're good at these! Help me out!

MARGE
How about... CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet?

HOMER
Fine, it's not important... What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself... vice president. (excitedly) No, wait! Junior vice president!

The phone rings, and Homer answers it.

HOMER
CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet, junior vice president Homer Simpson speaking, how may I direct your call? (disappointedly) It's Patty.

Homer hands the phone to Marge.

Back to the tropical island. Bart sounds the horn as all the kids return from their duties.

BART
Food patrol we're all starved. Let's see what you got.

Lisa pulls a few berries from her pocket.

BART
That's it?! What happened to all the lobsters, mangos and chewy chewy cocoa beans.

LISA
All we found were these oozing berries. And they look pretty poisonous.

RALPH
I ated the purple berries! Ow...

Ralph drops to the ground and continues moaning. The kids gather around Ralph, watching.

BART
How are they, Ralph? Good?

RALPH
They taste like... burning!

BART
Okay, food patrol blew it.

MILHOUSE
Yeah? Well your treehouse looks kinda crummy, too. Kinda REALLY crummy!

The tree house is just a bunch of sticks lying in a haphazard house shape.

BART
Well, when monsoon season comes, you'll be glad it's there!

With no assistance, the treehouse falls to pieces.

BART
No food. No shelter. No monkey butlers. This island is a death hole. We should have just swum for it like Otto.

Cut to Otto, in the middle of the ocean.

OTTO
Well, I'm done for... at least I'll leave a beautiful corpse.

Otto sinks underwater. A net pulls up and drags Otto with it.

OTTO
Whoa!

A seaman empties the net onto the deck of the boat.

OTTO
Ho! Thank the good dude I'm saved. And we can go back for the kids too.

Two fisherman converse in an East-Asian language.

FISHERMAN 1
(subtitle) Do we need another slave laborer in the cannery?

FISHERMAN 2
(subtitle) You can never have too many slave laborers.

OTTO
I think I'm going to like it on this boat.

Back on the island.

MILHOUSE
Run for your lives! Monster! Monster!

All the kids run and hide behind bushes or trees except Ralph who just covers his eyes. Realizing no monster is present, the kids come out of hiding.

NELSON
There's no monster you big scaredy. (teasingly) Scaredy got scared.

MILHOUSE
Well, you'd be scared too, if you saw a monster.

NELSON
Nu-uh.

MILHOUSE
Uh-huh!

NELSON
Unlikely!

MILHOUSE
Likely!

LISA
Knock it off! We gotta find a way to light a fire.

Lisa drops a bunch of sticks into a fire pit.

NELSON
No problem, we can use Scardie's glasses.

Nelson swipes Milhouse's glasses from his head, and proceeds to use them as a flint. Milhouse staggers around, dazed.

MILHOUSE
Hey. What's he doin'? What's that sound?

Nelson puts Milhouse's glasses back on his head.

NELSON
There you go. Good as new.

MILHOUSE
What's good as new? Who's talking?

It's night time and the kids sit around the fireplace.

TERRI
I'm so hungry I could eat at Arby's!

LISA
Oh my gosh!

NELSON
That IS hungry.

LISA
REALLY hungry...

We hear a low growling noise.

MILHOUSE
It's the monster!

Milhouse takes a few tokes from his asthma inhaler.

BART
No it's not, it's my tummy. (Nelson stares aggressively) I mean stomach! Gut! Crap factory!

Nelson nods in acknowledgement. Lisa gets some inspiration.

LISA
Wait a minute... we had a cooler full of snacks on the bus.

BART
Hey, yeah! And I think I know how I can get it.

Bart swipes Milhouse's inhaler.

MILHOUSE
Hey! I need that to live!

Bart swims out and dives down to the bus using the inhaler as a respirator. The bus is full of large sea life. He tugs on the door, and pulls it free. As he grabs the cooler, a puffed up puffer fish startles him and Bart screams. The puffer shrinks down to normal size. Bart laughs and turns to swim back to shore. The fish bites him on the ass. On shore...

BART
Does anyone here like... food?

The kids cheer and start tearing into the food stuffing their faces.

LISA
Stop! We may have to live on this food for a long time, so no more until tomorrow!

Lisa puts all the food in the cooler and closes it.

MILHOUSE
But I'm hungry now!

SHERRI
Me too!

NELSON
Yeah, who put the duchess of dork in charge?

LISA
No one, but if we're gonna survive we need rules and order. Let's not forget what we learned in the U.N. club.

Martin starts his Finnish dance.

LISA
Not now, Martin.

In the morning, the kids wake.

LISA
Who wants rations?!

Everyone shouts "Me, me!"

NELSON
I'm so hungry I could puke.

The kids go to the cooler, but it's empty.

SHERRI
Where'd all the food go?

They look over at a sleeping Milhouse and see candy wrappers all around him.

MILHOUSE
Morning. Is it time to eat?

Nelson pokes Milhouse in the stomach with a stick.

NELSON
Looks like you already did.

MILHOUSE
What're you talking about?

LEWIS
You ate our food!

TERRI
Thanks a lot, Milhouse. Now we're all gonna die because of you!

MILHOUSE
But I swear I didn't do it!

Milhouse belches and Nelson smells his breath.

NELSON
Nacho cheese. Get him!

Nelson raises a stick and all the kids converge on Milhouse.



ACT THREE

MILHOUSE
You wouldn't dare hurt me! You forget that I have... the glasses!

Nelson again takes the glasses of Milhouse's face.

NELSON
Yoink!

MILHOUSE
(nervously) Well... now that you've got every you need, I'll just, y'know, get out of your hair...

Milhouse turns around and walks away from Nelson, but bumps into him on the other side.

NELSON
Not so fast, two eyes! Come on, let's slice him open and get our food back!

LISA
Wait! We're not savages. We live in a society of law. Milhouse has the right to a fair trial.

All the kids groan, but relent.

NELSON
Society blows.

At the Android Dungeon the Comic Book Guy taps at his computer keyboard. You see a nude picture being downloaded on his screen.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh, Captain Janeway... Lace - the final brassiere!

The downloading is excruciating slow.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Hurry up! I'm a busy man.

Comic Book Guy slurps his soda for quite a while.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Ugh, this high-speed modem is intolerably slow!

Once the picture is about to reveal naked cleavage, Homer's "Internet King" ad pops up, covering the saucy parts.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Hey! What the-- the Internet King? I wonder if he can provide faster nudity.

The Comic Book Guy sits in Homer's "office".

HOMER
Welcome to the Internet, my friend, how can I help you?

COMIC BOOK GUY
I'm interested in upgrading my 28.8 kilobaud Internet connection to a 1.5 megabit fiber optic T1 line. Will you be able to provide an IP router that's compatible with my token ring Ethernet LAN configuration?

Homer stares at Comic Book Guy blankly in silence.

HOMER
Can I have some money now?

Back on the island. Milhouse is on trial. Bart is the judge and Milhouse is kept in a bamboo cage.

MILHOUSE
Is this cage really necessary?

BART
No talking in the cage. Court is now in session. All rise.

All the kids rise.

BART
Nah-ha, made you rise!

LISA
Your honor, the defense calls it's first and only witness -- Milhouse Van Houten.

The jury and Nelson, the prosecutor, mumble. Milhouse picks up the cage at the bottom and carries it with him as he moves near the judge's "bench."

LISA
Milhouse, did you steal the food?

MILHOUSE
Nuh-uh, no way.

LISA
Could anybody else have taken it?

MILHOUSE
Well... I guess you could have!

LISA
(surprised) Milhouse, I am defending you!

MILHOUSE
Oh, sorry, I'm just saying it was either you or the monster.

NELSON
Monster, pfft oh, please.

BART
I remind you, we are not here to debate the existence of monsters.

The kids grown in disappointment.

LISA
The defense has just one more question. Did any one of you actually see Milhouse eat the food? (no one answers) I rest my case.

BART
(to Nelson) Prosecutor. Your witness.

Nelson rises reading as he is examining a notepad. He paces a few times back and forth in front of Milhouse. Then he starts punching Milhouse.

NELSON
You liar! You did it! You lying jerk, take that! You did it, you did it!

LISA
Objection! He's not asking any questions.

BART
(thinking) Hmm. I'm gonna allow this.

Nelson punches Milhouse a bunch more times.

NELSON
Prosecution rests.

Nelson sits down.

BART
After careful deliberation, it's my opinion that Milhouse probably did eat the food. But since there's no proof, I must find him... Not Guilty!

Bart pounds his hammer-gavel on his rock-desk.

MILHOUSE
Alright!

Milhouse lifts the cage over his head and and tosses it aside.

MARTIN
But he ate our food!

LISA
The law has spoken.

NELSON
Ah, sucks to the law.

Nelson throws a rock and hits Milhouse and breaks his glasses. Other kids start picking up rocks.

LISA
Stop. Leave Milhouse alone! (to Bart) Help me out here, Bart.

BART
I don't know Lis. To be honest, that verdict made me pretty angry.

NELSON
Bart's with us, law girl. Step aside.

Nelson shoves Lisa. Bart intervenes.

BART
Hey man. Leave my sister alone!

NELSON
Oh, so you're one of them. (spits) So be it.

Nelson turns around and starts a chant.

NELSON
Kill the dorks!

LEWIS
Bash their butts!

SHERRI
Kick their shins!

KIDS
Kill the dorks! Bash their butts!

LISA
(chanting in the same way) Run a-way!

Bart, Lisa and Milhouse dart off. Nelson stops by the fire pit and paints his face with ashes.

NELSON
The hunt is on.

Back at the peaceful Simpsons house. Homer is reading "Internet for Dummies".

HOMER
Oh, they have the Internet on computers now!

MARGE
Homer, Bill Gates is here.

HOMER
Bill Gates?! Millionaire computer nerd Bill Gates! Oh my god. Oh my god. Get out of sight, Marge. I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation.

Marge groans and rolls her eyes. Bill Gates and two "associates" enter.

GATES
Mr. Simpson?

HOMER
You don't look so rich.

GATES
Don't let the haircut fool you, I am exceedingly wealthy.

HOMER
(quietly to Marge) Get a load of the bowl-job, Marge!

GATES
Your Internet ad was brought to my attention, but I can't figure out what, if anything, CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet does, so rather than risk competing with you, I've decided simply to buy you out.

Homer and Marge step aside to talk privately.

HOMER
This is it Marge. I've poured my heart and soul into this business and now it's finally paying off. (covering his mouth) We're rich! Richer than astronauts.

MARGE
Homer quiet. Acquire the deal.

HOMER
(to Gates) I reluctantly accept your proposal!

GATES
Well everyone always does. Buy 'em out, boys!

Bill Gates companions begin to trash the "office".

HOMER
Hey, what the hell's going on!

GATES
Oh, I didn't get rich by writing a lot of checks!

Bill Gates lets out a maniacal laugh. Homer and Marge cower in the corner as the room continues to be trashed.

On the island, Nelson and the others, all with war-painted faces, chase Bart, Lisa and Milhouse. They howl like Indians except for Ralph. Painted like a cat, Ralph meows. The chase goes on. Milhouse drops from exhaustion.

MILHOUSE
I can't go on, you two go ahead... and carry me with you!

Bart and Lisa groan and pick up Milhouse to carry him.

LISA
Come on, man!

MILHOUSE
Hurry, they're catching up.

The chase continues. The three come to a gorge. Bart grabs a vine hanging from a tree and hands it to Milhouse.

BART
Here, Milhouse, you go first.

Milhouse swings across.

BART
Okay. Now throw the vine back.

MILHOUSE
There's no time!

Milhouse runs off, stranding Bart and Lisa. Bart sees a loose tree and pushes it over to span the gorge. They run across and come upon Milhouse lying on a rock in front of a cave.

LISA
Look! We can hide in that cave.

They enter and it is black, except for their 6 eyes.

LISA
We should be safe in here.

NELSON
(from outside) They're trapped in the cave. Move in for the kill!

LISA
Oh, figs.

The cave lights up from the mobs torches. Lisa stands tall.

LISA
Stop! You are in violation of the Model U.N. charter!

Surprised the mob halts. So Lisa continues.

LISA
That's right. The U.N. doesn't look too kindly on--

NELSON
The Monster!

All the kids scream and run out of the cave. They are followed by a wild boar. The kids hide behind a rock, and peak out from behind once the "monster" emerges.

MARTIN
You're monster appears to be nothing but a run of the mill wild boar.

BART
Hey look at his tusk.

Everyone notices the Chippos bag on the boar's tusk.

NELSON
So the boar ate our food. Oh, sorry about that whole trying to kill you thing.

MILHOUSE
Yeah, well you should be. I only stole two sandwiches and a bag of Doritos.

LISA
Hey, if a boar can survive here, there must be a source of food! Look, he's licking slime off that rock! That's what he's been eating -- slime! And there's enough slime for all of us! We're saved!

The kids look unsure. That night, they roast the boar over the fire.

NELSON
Mmm, all that slime made the boar extra tender!

MARTIN
More snout anyone?

BART
Mmm. How's your dinner, Lis?

Lisa is licking slime from a rock.

LISA
Ah, shut up... savages...

The camera slowly zooms out from the kids eating, and eventually shows the whole island. James Earl Jones narrates the ending to the story:

NARRATOR
So the children learned how to function as a society, and eventually they were rescued by, oh, let's say... Moe.



#### SETT 14 ####
ACT ONE

At the Simpson home, Homer calls everyone together.

HOMER
Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone! All right, one for... resident.

MARGE
That's me!

HOMER
Well, that's it.

BART
One stinkin' letter? Why'd you make us gather 'round like that?

HOMER
I needed my power fix. (sighs with pleasure)

MARGE
Hey, listen to this! (reads letter) "Congratulations, your child, or children, have been selected to appear in 'Who's Who Among American Elementary School Students.'"

Homer gasps, then belches.

MARGE
"Please submit their names, along with ninety-five dollars, for each handsome volume you wish to order!" Oh, I've never been so proud! (kisses both of them) You both deserve a big, big reward!

LISA
Mom, they put every kid in America in that book, just so gullible parents will buy it. It's all a big scam.

BART
(quietly to Lisa) Shut up...

MARGE
Are you sure? I can usually smell a scam from two towns over.

BART
(winking at Lisa) Yeah, Lis, she is a smart, sophisticated woman. Now, let's hear more about that big, big reward.

HOMER
Yeah, quit stalling, Marge, we want our reward.

The Simpsons arrive at the Family Fun Center.

MARGE
One reward, coming up! Tada!

Everyone cheers. The family park and get out of the car.

HOMER
Oh man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooh, go-karts! Come on, everybody, let's go!

The family, Milhouse and Nelson drive around the go-kart track.

HOMER
Hehehehe, Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!

BART
We're all proud of you, Dad.

Lisa tries to get past Marge.

LISA
Move it, pokey.

MARGE
Slow and steady wins the race! (Lisa, and the others pass Marge twice each.) Easy, easy, stick with the plan.

Nelson is passing Milhouse, who is wearing a crash helmet. He bumps into Milhouse and knocks him over, but he bounces back up off the side cushion.

NELSON
Uh, are you alright, man?

MILHOUSE
Uh, I think so.

NELSON
How about now?

Nelson bumps him harder, and Milhouse crashes.

MILHOUSE
Aah!

MARGE
That was no accident. Shame on you, Nelson Muntz!

NELSON
Cram it, ma'am.

Bart and Lisa watch Homer try out a batting cage.

HOMER
Stand back and watch the pro.

LISA
Uh, shouldn't you put on a batting helmet?

HOMER
Nah, they mess up my hair.

Homer puts a coin in the machine, and it fires a ball at him. He misses.

HOMER
Ooh, ball one. (he misses again) Ball two. This bozo's gonna walk me. (ball hits him on the head) Hey! You're goin' down, you-- (hit) d'oh! (hit) why you-- (hit) ow!!

He falls to the ground and several more balls hit him.

LISA
Hang in there, Dad, just half a basket left!

BART
Wow, you sure get a lot of balls for a quarter.

Lisa plays skee-ball. She bowls the ball, and Maggie, sat on top of the machine, catches it and puts it into the middle hole.

LISA
Yes! Maggie you!

NELSON
Hey, that's cheating!

He takes the machine apart and pulls out a roll of tickets. Bart is at the counter.

BART
Okay, what can I get for twelve, count 'em, twelve prize tickets?

TEENAGER
Two thumbtacks and a moustache comb. Or five rubber bands and an ice cube.

NELSON
What can I get for eight thousand tickets?

TEENAGER
A BB Gun or an Easy Bake Oven.

NELSON
Hmm... hot food is tempting. But I just can't say no to a weapon.

BART
Whoa! Can I try that sometime?

NELSON
Yeah, sure. Never hurts to have a second set of prints on a gun.

BART
Wow, thanks, Nelson, I'll come by your house later!

MARGE
Oh, no you won't! You stay away from Nelson Muntz.

BART
But Mom!

MARGE
Nelson's a troubled, lonely, sad little boy. He needs to be isolated from everyone.

BART
But Mom!

MARGE
Yes?

BART
That's all I got.

Back at home, Lisa talks to Bart in his room.

LISA
So what prize did you end up getting?

BART
Moustache comb. What'd you get?

LISA
Fake moustache. Wanna comb it?

BART
Oh, this sucks. It's time to punch out of this yawn factory. I'm going to Nelson's.

He jumps out of the window, onto a tree branch.

LISA
But Mom said not to.

BART
She doesn't scare me. I do what I want, when I want. (brushes himself off) Oh God, inchworms!

Bart arrives at Nelson's house. Nelson carves a message of the wall. It reads, "Mom - Dad called, Re: Bail".

BART
Won't you get in trouble if your Mom sees you doing that?

NELSON
Eh, my Mom's got bigger problems. She doesn't give a crap what I do.

BART
Wow, you are so lucky.

NELSON
Come on, let's lock and load. (stops Bart) You're not going out without a scarf, are you?

BART
Nah, I don't need one.

NELSON
Eh, it's your health.

In the backyard, Nelson practices shooting.

NELSON
Think I can hit that bottle?

BART
Yeah, probably.

Nelson shoots and hits the bottle.

NELSON
Shows what you know. Hey, check this out! (he shoots at an old car) That's my Dad's shooting car. Just three more payments and it's ours.

BART
Aw cool! Can I get a shot now?

NELSON
Hang on! First how about I try and peg you in the stomach?

BART
Mm, no thanks.

NELSON
Or what about you put on these nerd glasses and I try to shoot them off?

BART
No way! Come on, quit hogging the gun!

The boys notice a bird singing in a tree. Nelson gives Bart the gun.

NELSON
Bet you can't hit that bird from here.

BART
Are you crazy? I don't want to shoot a stupid bird.

NELSON
That's 'cause you know you can't. You're not a super-stud like me!

BART
Am too!

NELSON
Are not! You're an octo-wussy. (mocking Bart) Whoa, look at me, I'm Bart Simpson! I'm scared to use a gun! I'm gonna marry Milhouse! I walk around like this. (he dances) La, la, la, la, la, la...

BART
Hey, quit it! Hmm...

Bart aims the gun towards the bird. He lines it up, but then moves it to the right and fires. He hits the bird, and it falls to the ground.

BART
Oh my god!

NELSON
Whoa, major shot! You even compensated for the crooked sight!

BART
Crooked sight?

NELSON
You are one cold blooded killer, dude!

BART
But, but, I wasn't... I didn't...

Nelson runs over to examine the bird.

NELSON
Right through the neck! (He whistles.) Doesn't get any sweeter than that, Simpson. Savor the moment.

BART
Oh...



ACT TWO

At home, Homer and Marge fold laundry. Homer hands Marge a ball of socks.

HOMER
Okay, I rolled up all the socks, what's next?

MARGE
(groans) While I deal with this, why don't you start on that basket?

HOMER
All right... oh, I hate folding sheets.

MARGE
That's your underwear.

HOMER
Well, whatever it is, it's a two man job. Where's Bart?

MARGE
He's up in his room. (calls upstairs) Bart!

HOMER
It's okay, Marge, I'll get him. (yelling very loudly) Bart!!!

LISA
(walking in) What the heck's going on?

MARGE
We need Bart to help fold your father's underpants. Where is he, anyway?

LISA
Bart? Uh, he went to play with a friend.

MARGE
He didn't go to Nelson's, did he?

LISA
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's with Milhouse.

HOMER
(leaning out the window and yelling even louder) MILHOUSE!!!

MILHOUSE
(yelling from a distance) WHAT?!!

HOMER
TELL BART TO COME HOME!!!

MILHOUSE
I THINK HE'S AT NELSON'S!!!

HOMER
WHO'S NELSON?!!

MARGE
Nelson?! I explicitly forbade Bart from playing with that little monster. Ooh, Bart is in deep, deep trouble. (she starts to walk out, then turns back to Homer) Oh yes, and punish Lisa for lying to us. (she leaves)

HOMER
(giving Lisa some money) Alright young lady, I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer! (he pauses then gives her more money.) Get a little something for your self, honey.

Back at Nelson's. The boys examine the bird.

NELSON
Should we bury it, or chuck it into a car full of girls?

BART
Hey, leave it alone!

NELSON
Okay, okay, don't kill me, killer.

BART
Don't calling me that!

NELSON
Relax, Simpson, it was either him or you. No court would convict you.

Bart imagines himself in court, with birds as the judges.

EAGLE
Bart Simpson, do you know why you've been summoned before this tribunal?

BART
Yes, sir. Because I killed an innocent bird.

VULTURE
Dear Lord! We just wanted you to put fresh newspaper on the tribunal floor!

EAGLE
We're knee-deep in our own droppings. It's disgusting.

TOUCAN
But since you've confessed to bird-slaughter, we have no choice but to peck your face off.

BART
No, not the face! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

The birds peck him in the face. The scene fades back to Nelson's backyard, where Nelson repeatedly slaps Bart across the face.

BART
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ow, what are you doing?!

NELSON
Eh, I got bored, so I started slapping you.

Marge pulls up in the car. Bart stands in front of the dead bird to hide it from her.

BART
(gasp) Uh oh!

MARGE
Young man, you're coming home with me this minute.

NELSON
All right, finally, a real home!

MARGE
Not you... Bart!

NELSON
Oh. See you later, Killer!

MARGE
"Killer"? Why did he call you "Killer"?

BART
Mom, you were right. Nelson is bad news. Can we go home?

MARGE
What are you hiding there?

BART
Nothing! (some cats congregate behind him)

MARGE
What are those cats doing behind you?

BART
Uh... cats like me? (a cat jumps from the tree onto his shoulder) Get... get off! Get off!

All the cats run away, leaving the dead bird exposed.

MARGE
(gasp) Bart! Did you kill that poor bird?

BART
I didn't mean to, Mom. The gun pulled to the left--

MARGE
You disobeyed me, snuck over here, and murdered a helpless animal?

BART
I know, I really screwed up. I deserve to be punished.

MARGE
What's the point, Bart? I punish, and I punish, and I punish, but it never sinks in. So you know what? Do what you want. You wanna play with little hoodlums, fine. Have fun killing things.

BART
Mom, wait!

Marge drives off. Bart turns back to Nelson's house. Nelson is frying a carrot and humming the Simpsons theme. He then notices a nest, with eggs in, up in the tree.

BART
Oh my god! (he climbs the tree) Hi little eggs. I'm not sure how to tell you this, but... y-your mother was involved in an incident. Mistakes were made... by me. But don't worry, I'll take care of you.

Bart takes the eggs. He visits Springfield Library, where he watches a film called "Birds: Our Fine Feathered Colleagues". Troy McClure stars.

TROY
Hi, I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such nature films as "Earwigs, Ew!", and "Man Versus Nature: The Road to Victory". In all the animal kingdom, no mother is more devoted than the blue jay. Valuing her eggs above even her own life, the mother bird regularly fights off such fearsome predators as the badger and the mongoose.

In a tree, Troy puts a badger and a mongoose on the branch next to her. The mother chases them off.

TROY
Of course, one thing Mother blue jay can't defend against is a set of steel tongs.

He lifts the bird out of the nest with the tongs, revealing the eggs.

TROY
Eggs. Precious eggs. If they're to survive, they require the gentle warmth and tender love that only a mother can provide. Or better yet, a seventy-five watt bulb.

In a laboratory, Troy places the eggs into a glass box, lit with a light bulb.

TROY
Oh, hello! In a few days, our eggs will hatch into nestlings, like these over here.

He walks over to a cage of nestlings. A boy enters the scene.

BILLY
They look awfully hungry, Mr. McClure.

TROY
They sure are, Billy. In nature, their mother would regurgitate food for them to eat.

BILLY
That's gross!

TROY
(laughs) It sure is, Billy. It sure is.

The film ends. Bart writes a few things down, and leaves. He passes Reverend Lovejoy, checking out a book.

LIBRARIAN
You've checked out this Bible every weekend for the last nine years. Surely it would be easier just to buy one?

REVEREND LOVEJOY
Perhaps, on a librarian's salary.

In the tree house, Bart sets up the nest as on the video.

BART
Hey fellas, good news! I found an extra seventy-five watt light bulb lying around!

In the house, Homer carries a box to the basement, whistling. He switches the light on, but it does not come on and he falls down the stairs.

HOMER
D'oh!

When he reaches the bottom, he starts whistling again.

BART
Check it out guys, I've been working on this regurgitation thing. (he makes a choking sound) Oh yeah, hope you like Pop Tarts! (looking at the eggs) I think I'll call you Chirpy Boy, and you Bart Junior. And you can call me Mother. No, wait, that sounds kinda fruity. Just call me Mom.

Bart protects the eggs. He moves the light bulb closer when it is too cold and protects the eggs from the rain with a parasol. Homer falls down the basement stairs several times during this sequence. Finally, Bart appears from the trapdoor to hose the cat when it gets too close. The cat runs into the kitchen, shakes itself off onto the dog, who in turn shakes himself off onto Homer. Homer shakes himself off and gets a beer.

MARGE
What do you think he's doing up there?

HOMER
I don't know. Drug lab?

MARGE
Drug lab?!

HOMER
Or reading comic books, what am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing.

MARGE
I don't know, and I don't want to know. And I'm going to find out.

Marge walks outside and sees a cable running up to the tree house.

MARGE
Oh, my good gray extension cord!

She unplugs it. In the tree house, the light bulb goes out.

BART
Oh, no! I've got to keep these warm.

MARGE
(calling up) Bart, stop whatever you're doing and come down here!

BART
Can't right now! Come back later.

MARGE
(climbing tree) Oh, I'll come back later. (reaches top) How's this for later?

BART
Mom, listen--

MARGE
Why are you sitting like that? What are you hiding this time?

Bart moves away to reveal the eggs.

MARGE
Eggs?

BART
That bird I killed was their mother. I don't want her babies to die, too.

Marge prepares to tell Bart off, but can't do it.

MARGE
Hmm, oh, oh honey come here.

She hugs him, but notices one of the eggs hatching.

MARGE
Oh my goodness, look!

In the kitchen, the eggs are sat on a table.

HOMER
Oh man, this is the most exiting thing I've ever seen since Hailey's comet collided with the moon.

LISA
That never happened, Dad.

HOMER
Sure it didn't...

BART
Is the nest still warm enough, Mom?

MARGE
Hmm, they're starting to cool down. I'll bake another pie.

She pulls out a pie from underneath the nest. Homer grabs it.

HOMER
Ooh, how about cherry this time? And would it kill ya to make some coffee?

The family stare at the eggs.

HOMER
Why's it taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.

MARGE
Actually, it took fifty-three hours.

HOMER
Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?

Marge groans. Later, the eggs start to hatch.

BART
Everybody come quick! They're hatching!

MARGE
I see a foot!

LISA
I see an eye!

BART
I see a neck!

HOMER
I see a horn!

LISA
A horn?

Two lizards hatch from the eggs, looking cute.

FAMILY
Aw...

The lizards suddenly turn and hiss at them.

FAMILY
Aah!



ACT THREE

The family look at the lizards.

BART
Man, those are some funky-looking birds.

HOMER
Oh, hehehehehe, you look like a little tiny dinosaur. (He touches one, and it bites his finger.) Aah! This is one vicious baby bird.

LISA
Dad, they aren't birds.

BART
Sure they are. They came from eggs in a bird's nest. Therefore, they're birds. Ikso fatso.

LISA
One, they don't have beaks, two, they don't have feathers, and three, they're lizards!

BART
You're a lizard!

HOMER
Enough bickering! I know how to settle this.

MARGE
No kickboxing!

HOMER
Aw... (takes the pie) if anybody wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement.

He walks out, and falls down the basement stairs yet again.

At a local bird-watching society. Principal Skinner leads the discussion.

SKINNER
Now, uh, people. There's been some confusion about our bird sighting rules. You cannot count birds that you've seen at the zoo, on stamps, or in dreams.

MOE
Well, I'm back to square one.

He tears up his piece of paper. A pigeon lands on the window sill. Jasper looks at it through binoculars.

JASPER
My god - a pigeon. That's the last bird on my list. Heh. So long, suckers!

He leaves, and Bart, Marge and Lisa enter, with the lizards.

BART
Excuse me, can you tell us what type of birds these are?

SKINNER
Good heavens! I'm very glad you brought those in, Bart. I'll just get them killed, and you can be on your way.

He puts the lizards under a paper cutter and is about to kill them, when Bart snatches them back.

BART
Hey! What the heck are you doing?

SKINNER
(holding up a notepad) My civic duty, that's what.

LISA
(reading notepad) Bolivian Tree Lizards?

SKINNER
Mm-hmm. It's a vicious ovoraptor. It feasts on bird eggs and lays its own in the nest. The unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch and... devour her too.

MOE
(laughing) What a chump!

SKINNER
It's already wiped out the Dodo, the Cuckoo, and the Ne-Ne, and it has nasty plans for the Booby, the Titmouse, the Woodcock, and the Titpecker.

MARGE
How vile!

SKINNER
The one thing that mystifies me is how a Bolivian Tree Lizard made it to Springfield.

APU
(coughs, looking shifty) That... is a puzzlement...

The scene dissolves to the Kwik-E-Mart some time ago. Apu opens a box of donuts from Bolivia. Two lizards escape from the box and leave the store. The scene fades back to reality, where Apu still looks shifty.

BURNS
Look, Skinner, we haven't got all day. Kill the horrid beasts... and do away with their lizards.

BART
No, don't hurt them! I'll just keep them as pets.

SKINNER
No, they might escape and breed. The law is very clear on this, they must be exterminated as quickly and gruesomely as possible. (holds up an electric drill)

BART
No, they're mine!

MARGE
I'm sure we can work this out. He's just a child. Let me talk to him.

SKINNER
All right, I'll give you a moment. That'll give us time to prepare for the splatter.

Several people put on safety goggles. Marge takes Bart outside and shuts the door.

MARGE
Bart, I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Your lizards are banned by federal law.

BART
Everyone thinks they're monsters. But I raised them, and I love them! I know that's hard to understand.

MARGE
Not as hard as you think. (whispering) Run for it.

BART
Really?

She nods. Bart gives her a kiss and runs off. Skinner opens the door.

SKINNER
(looking at his watch) Okay, that's exactly one moment-- (gasps) Oh my God, he's getting away!

SMITHERS
Stop him!

MOE
Out of the way, Midge.

MARGE
(blocking the doorway) Oh, am I in the way?

BURNS
Yes, yes, you're in the way! Are you daft, woman?

MARGE
(still blocking the doorway) Sorry, I didn't realize I was in the way.

SKINNER
You're still in the way. You don't seem to be moving at all.

EDNA KREBAPPEL
Oh, for crying out loud, just knock her ass down.

She pushes Marge aside.

MOE
Way to shove, Edna.

APU
Let us roll.

Bart, hiding in an empty room, talks to his lizards.

BART
Guys, is it really true? Are you really egg-killers? (they look at him innocently) Don't use that look on me, I invented that look.

The bird-watching society burst in. Burns looks through binoculars from the wrong end.

BURNS
There he is! Off in the distance!

Bart runs up the stairs, and onto the roof.

SKINNER
Okay Bart. This is where it ends. Relinquish the lizards. (Bart turns away) I said, relinquish!

Skinner grabs the box, and they struggle. He pulls the lid off, and the lizards fly off the roof.

BART
Oh no! You killed them!

SKINNER
Good riddance to bad lizards.

Suddenly, the lizards spread out some flaps and glide to the ground.

BART
Hey! Whoa, look at them! Go Chirpy Boy! Go Bart Junior!

SKINNER
Oh, nuts!

LISA
Wow, did you know they had those webbed flaps for gliding?

SKINNER
Yes. But I was hoping they didn't know that. (The lizards reach the ground and run off) Well, I hope you're happy, Bart. You have no idea what kind of plague you've unleashed upon this town.

Kent Brockman reads the news.

KENT
Our top story, the population of parasitic tree lizards has exploded, and local citizens couldn't be happier! It seems the rapacious reptiles have developed a taste for the common pigeon, also known as the 'feathered rat', or the 'gutter bird'. For the first time, citizens need not fear harassment by flocks of chattering disease-bags.

Later, Bart receives an award from Mayor Quimby outside the town hall. Several lizards slink past.

QUIMBY
For decimating our pigeon population, and making Springfield a less oppressive place to while away our worthless lives, I present you with this scented candle.

Skinner talks to Lisa.

SKINNER
Well, I was wrong. The lizards are a godsend.

LISA
But isn't that a bit short-sighted? What happens when we're overrun by lizards?

SKINNER
No problem. We simply unleash wave after wave of Chinese needle snakes. They'll wipe out the lizards.

LISA
But aren't the snakes even worse?

SKINNER
Yes, but we're prepared for that. We've lined up a fabulous type of gorilla that thrives on snake meat.

LISA
But then we're stuck with gorillas!

SKINNER
No, that's the beautiful part. When wintertime rolls around, the gorillas simply freeze to death.

The family head back to the car.

HOMER
I'm proud of you boy. (sniffs candle) Mmm... loganberry.

LISA
I don't get it, Bart. You got all upset when you killed one bird, but now you've killed tens of thousands, and it doesn't bother you at all.

BART
Hey, you're right... (pause) I call the front seat!

LISA
You had it on the way over!

As the kids fight for the front seat, a pigeon is dragged to the ground and killed by a group of lizards. Fade to credits.



#### SET 15 ####
ACT ONE

The Simpsons family are in the kitchen, gathered for breakfast.

BART
Mmm, good pancakes, Mom!

MARGE
Oh, thank you, honey! They come in a squeeze bottle now.

Marge squeezes the bottle, and it makes a flatulent noise.

MARGE
Woo! Oh, I'd better put the silencer on.

She screws on the silencer, and the bottle now makes a 'zapping' noise.

LISA
You know what would be good with these, is some Ms. Butterworth.

She opens the fridge and takes out the bottle, but then notices something at the back. She pulls out an old box.

LISA
Eww! How long has this baking soda been in here?

MARGE
I don't know, it came with the house.

BART
Hey Dad, bet you five bucks you can't eat the whole box.

HOMER
Five? Why don't we make it fifty?

He slaps a fifty dollar bill on the table.

HOMER
Ho ho, you're going to regret this!

LISA
I'll call poison control. (She dials the phone.) Fran, it's me. Just a heads-up.

HOMER
Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals. (He eats a spoonful of it.) So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

Homer has visions of several different foods, set to sound bites of American history. First we hear "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit" spoken by Johnny Cochran, with a hamburger and fries. Next is part of Nixon's resignation speech, "Therefore, I shall resign the presidency" with a pie. Finally, a meatball sandwich accompanies Neil Armstrong's moon landing, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." We cut back to the kitchen, where Homer's head rests on the table with foam coming out of his mouth and nostrils.

LISA
Uh-oh, Dad's having another antacid trip.

BART
And I won fifty bucks!

He takes the money and leaves.

Bart is walking down the street, with an excited Milhouse dancing in circles around him.

MILHOUSE
Can I see the fifty Bart? Can I? Huh?

BART
Milhouse, my friend, you and I are going on a spending spree.

MILHOUSE
My doctor says I'm not supposed to go on sprees.

BART
What about jags?

MILHOUSE
Jags are fine.

BART
Wonderful!

The boys enter the Kwik-E-Mart. Bart walks up to the counter, holding out the bill and coughing.

APU
(gasps) A fifty dollar bill! (He runs to the door and locks it.) Gentlemen. Let us shop.

Apu and the boys walk down an aisle.

APU
Our wide variety of gum comes in both stick and ball.

BART
I'm not really about gum, but I like the whole chewing thing.

APU
Are you averse to crispy centers, sir?

BART
Not at all.

APU
Then we have much to discuss.

The boys sit outside the store.

BART
(groaning) Oh, too much raw bacon.

MILHOUSE
Come on, Bart, we can't stop spending now. There's one thing I've always wanted to do.

Cut to a Laundromat, where Bart and Milhouse stand in their underwear.

MILHOUSE
My mom doesn't believe in fabric softener - but she's not around! Hahaha!

BART
I'm picking the next thing.

Back on the street again.

BART
Looks like we're down to our last ten bucks. Hello!

He sees a Radioactive Man comic, #1000 for sale. They go inside. Bart places the bill on the counter.

BART
Radioactive Man number one thousand, please.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Ten dollars? I laugh at you. Please to note that this is no ordinary comic book, it is in perma-mint condition. If you spill soda on it, the drops fly off harmlessly onto lesser comics.

Comic Book Guy demonstrates. His drink flies off onto a Bongo comic book. The boys gasp.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Yes, you are quite right to gasp. Also note the price - twenty five dollars.

BART
(to Milhouse) We had to buy lunch for that homeless guy.

Mrs. Prince walks into the store, holding a box of stuff.

MRS. PRINCE
While my son's at Fat Camp, I cleaned out his room. How much will you give me for this?

COMIC BOOK GUY
Probably nothing, but let us see... oh! A handwritten script for Star Wars by George Lucas? Princess Leia's anti-jiggle breast tape? Film reel labelled, "Alternate ending - Luke's father is Chewbacca"?! Oh!! Oh!! (calmly) I'll give you five dollars for the box.

MRS. PRINCE
Sold!

BART
Don't do it, lady, that stuff's worth thousands!

MILHOUSE
Yeah, he's ripping you off!

MRS. PRINCE
Well, if this stuff is valuable, then back to the leaky basement it goes. Hmph!

She walks out. Comic Book Guy holds up a camera to the boys.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Smile, please.

The boys smile, and Comic Book Guy takes a picture, and places it under a "Banned For Life" sign, next to Sideshow Bob, Nelon, and Matt Groening.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Thank you.

Back at home, Homer comforts Bart.

HOMER
Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning.

We see Homer's recollection. He is at a Gallagher show. Gallagher is about to hit a melon on a stool, but someone takes it at the last minute, and the mallet rebounds and hits him in the face.

GALLAGHER
Ow! Hey, where's my melon?

We see Homer is eating it. The scene then cuts to Homer being thrown out.

GALLAGHER
...and you are banned for life from all of my performances, and TV specials!

HOMER
But I can still see your movies, right?

Gallagher growls angrily and slams the door. Homer starts crying, and we dissolve back into the present, where Homer is also crying.

HOMER
(he sniffs) And I never saw Gallagher again.

Lisa is reading the "Daily Set-Up"

LISA
Ooh, it says here that special effects wiz Tom Savini is going to be appearing at the comic book store tonight.

HOMER
Tom Savini?

MARGE
Yes. It says here he's the movie magician behind Creepshow, Friday The 13th, and Dawn Of The Dead.

BART
Oh, I can't believe I'm gonna miss that.

HOMER
Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.

BART
How could you have it planned out, you just heard about the problem.

HOMER
You're right! Give me a minute. Hmm...

It is the evening. A very tall Homer walks along the sidewalk. His long coat opens to reveal that he is standing on Bart's shoulders, who is in turn standing on Milhouse's shoulders.

MILHOUSE
Mr. Simpson, it hurts!

BART
Yeah, and why did we have to do this all the way from home?

HOMER
For once in my life, I'm tall! Don't take that away from me!

He closes his coat as he approaches Comic Book Guy.

HOMER
(in a posh voice) Hello, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please.

Comic Book Guy yanks off the long coat to reveal Bart and Milhouse.

COMIC BOOK GUY
You two are not welcome!

Homer gets off their shoulders.

HOMER
I'm sorry, son.

COMIC BOOK GUY
(giving Homer a wad of cash) Thanks for the tip-off.

HOMER
No problem.

Inside the store, Comic Book Guy introduces Tom Savini.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Appearing exclusively here at the Android's Dungeon - take that, Monsieurs Barnes and Noble - the king of splatter, Tom Savini.

The audience applauds.

TOM SAVINI
Good evening. (he burps) Sorry, I had a really big dinner.

HOMER
Woo! Dinner!

TOM SAVINI
But I'm sure one more French fry wouldn't hurt.

He eats the French fry, swells up like a balloon, and his belly explodes, covering the audience with 'blood and guts'. The audience applauds. Outside, Bart and Milhouse try to see through the window.

MILHOUSE
Oh, we missed the "Gut-buster".

BART
Yeah, that should be us covered with blood.

Back in the store, Savini is sitting down, with his head on a table next to him.

TOM SAVINI
Sure, computer technology is here to stay, but there'll always be a place for the practical special effects wizard.

Savini puts his head back on. The audience applaud, except for Comic Book Guy.

HOMER
I love the theatre.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh, please. I saw Paul Lynde do that same hackneyed trick on Bewitched. (He picks up a cookie and eats it.) Try to explode this out of my belly.

TOM SAVINI
That's not a cookie, it's a time-release blood pack.

Blood pours out of Comic Book Guy's mouth. He wipes it off on his shirt.

TOM SAVINI
You, sir, are a perfect patsy. Let me shake your hand.

Savini shakes his hand. The hand comes off.

COMIC BOOK GUY
(not impressed) For the gag, I will give a D plus. As for the workmanship on the hand...

Suddenly, the hand comes to life. It runs up his arm and down his back, and gives him a wedgie.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Ooh! Ooh! That's not right!

The audience laugh.

COMIC BOOK GUY
You mocking me!? Oh, that is rich!

The hand pulls him off stage, and he crashes into a stand of wizard hats. He emerges with two hats stuck to his chest as if he has breasts. The audience laugh even harder.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Stop your laughing! You're all banned! Banned, I tell you!

He reaches out, but stops to clutch his chest.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Ooh! Ooh! Breath... short! Left arm... numb! Can't go on... describing symptoms much longer!

He collapses. Tom Savini rushes over and puts his ear to his chest.

TOM SAVINI
I think he's had a heart attack!

The audience gasp.



ACT TWO

Comic Book Guy is in Springfield General Hospital. Dr. Hibbert, Homer, Bart and Milhouse are at his bedside.

DR. HIBBERT
Young man, you've had what we call a "cardiac episode."

COMIC BOOK GUY
Worst episode ever.

DR. HIBBERT
Oh, not even close. If these boys hadn't called 911, I'd be wearing that watch right now. (He chuckles) I'm just kidding. But you would be dead.

COMIC BOOK GUY
You saved my life?

BART
Yeah, after you were so mean to us.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh. So now we're even.

DR. HIBBERT
My prognosis... or is is diagnosis? Whichever. You need to avoid stress. What kind of work do you do?

COMIC BOOK GUY
I run a comic book store.

DR. HIBBERT
Oh dear Lord! We call that profession "The Widow-maker" - or we would, if any of the proprietors were married. You should close down the store for a while.

COMIC BOOK GUY
But I'd lose all my business to Frodo's of Shelbyville!

DR. HIBBERT
Well, get a friend to run it for you. You do have friends, don't you?

COMIC BOOK GUY
Well, the Super Friends.

DR. HIBBERT
You should get some friends who aren't printed on paper.

COMIC BOOK GUY
What, you mean action figures?

MILHOUSE
We'll run the store for you!

COMIC BOOK GUY
Two ten-year-olds running my store? Wh-what is this, Bizzaro-World?

DR. HIBBERT
Calm down! Don't make me put a dog heart in there!

The boys end up running the store. They turn up the next day.

MILHOUSE
Can you believe it, Bart? We're actually running a comic book store!

BART
(looking at the "Banned for Life" section) Looks like our lifetime ban just expired.

He takes his photo off the wall, but an alarm sounds. He quickly puts it back.

BART
Sorry, sorry!

MILHOUSE
Okay, here's Comic Book Guy's instructions: A carton of malted-milk balls, one box confectioners' sugar, a can of chocolate frosting...

BART
That's just his shopping list.

MILHOUSE
No, it's his instructions.

BART
Well, we're going to make a few changes around here. This store's going to be run by kids, for kids.

MILHOUSE
You said it, partner.

The next day. A banner is hung up outside the store, reading "Under New Management." Cut to inside the store, where Bart chats up the customers.

BART
Ah nice to see ya. How about that Bloodzilla? (laughing) Vampire dinosaur? You can't make that stuff up.

Nelson reads a comic.

NELSON
"The Death of Sad Sack". This better not be another fake-out.

Ralph tries to enter the adult section.

BART
Uh-uh. You gotta be forty inches tall for the adult section.

RALPH
Please?

BART
Okay, get on your tippy-toes.

He does as Bart says, and goes in.

RALPH
Everybody's hugging!

MILHOUSE
Hey, Bart. I finished organizing the stock room.

BART
Mark down the Poochie crap, and then un-stick all the Supergirls.

MILHOUSE
You know, if we're partners, maybe you should do some of the work.

BART
Less barking, more marking.

MILHOUSE
Yes sir, partner!

As he begins, Bart can be seen walking home in the window, with a coat and hat on.

Homer is outside Moe's with Comic Book Guy.

HOMER
Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the rum district.

He opens the door to reveal Moe pointing a shotgun at one of the bar flies.

MOE
Get out! And take your Sacajawea dollars with you! I'll give you till three. One...

He pulls the trigger. He notices Homer and Comic Book Guy standing in the doorway.

MOE
Hey Homer, who's the manatee?

The bar flies laugh.

HOMER
Aw, be nice Moe, This guy just got out of the hospital.

MOE
Oh, sorry. Lemme buy ya a drink.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Very well. I will have a shot of cranberry schnapps. (He points to bottles on the shelf.)

MOE
Uh, these, they're just painted on there. Your choices are beer and egg soakings.

COMIC BOOK GUY
I'll pass. Beer is the nectar of the nitwit.

CARL
Hey, you knockin' beer?

LENNY
Nobody badmouths Duff!

He tries to smash the end off a bottle, but it completely disintegrates.

LENNY
Aw, piece of crap.

HOMER
Come on! You're here to make friends.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh, please. If I wanted to listen to mindless droning, I'd... befriend an air conditioner.

MOE
Now he's ragging on air conditioners!

CARL
Hey, they keep us cool in the summer, pal!

LENNY
Get him!

Moe, Lenny and Carl throw him out the door. He slides into the gutter.

MOE
And stay out!

COMIC BOOK GUY
Is there a word in Klingon for loneliness? (looks in a pocket book) Ah, yes: Gardachk!

Lisa visits The Androids Dungeon. Milhouse is behind the counter.

LISA
Milhouse, I'm impressed. The store is so busy, you and Bart are great businessmen.

MILHOUSE
Well, I'm really the brains. Bart's just the eye-candy.

A man walks into the store.

SALESMAN
Hi. Derek Reynolds, Plan Nine Comics. Is the manager here?

MILHOUSE
I'm kinda the co-manager.

Milhouse imagines himself in a film-noir, with Lisa as the femme-fatale character.

LISA
Tough break toots. I need a man who answers to noone. A full manager.

MILHOUSE
Achie-machie!

The vision dissolves back to reality.

MILHOUSE
I can help you sir. And I answer no no-one.

He winks at Lisa, who doesn't understand.

SALESMAN
Well then, you'll want to stock up on our new superhero.

MILHOUSE
Would you say he's the ultimate superhero?

SALESMAN
Oh, very ultimate indeed. Point your peepers... (he pulls a comic out of his briefcase) at Biclops!

MILHOUSE
(gasp) A superhero with glasses!

SALESMAN
Yeah, thick glasses... kinda like yours. So how many copies can I put you down for? Five hundred? Six hundred?

MILHOUSE
Six hundred sounds good.

SALESMAN
Oh, too bad, there's a price break at a thousand.

MILHOUSE
Oh, man!

Milhouse thinks, looking at a photo of Bart frowning on the counter. Finally, he puts it face down on the counter.

MILHOUSE
I'll take two thousand!

Comic Book Guy is standing at the door to a classroom, about to enroll in a "How To Make Friends" class.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Human contact... the final frontier.

He reaches out for the handle, when Agnes Skinner pushes past him.

AGNES
Out of the way, tubby!

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh, pardon me, Oldie Hawn.

AGNES
Why, you ill-mannered sack of crap!

COMIC BOOK GUY
Oh, goody. Now I know whatever happened to Baby Jane.

AGNES
You are the rudest man who ever... (suggestively) bought me dinner.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Correction! I do not believe I have ever bought you... (realizes) Oh.

They both smile at each other.

Kearney walks into the store.

MILHOUSE
So, how many issues of Biclops would you like?

KEARNEY
Biclops? Who's his girlfriend, Lois Lame?

MILHOUSE
He's kinda afraid of girls.

Kearney tries to hit him over the head with the comic, but it crumples.

KEARNEY
Aw, it doesn't even smack good.

He leaves, and Bart enters.

BART
How could you spend all of our money on a comic book published by Lenscrafters? We'll never sell these. Birds won't even use them in their nests.

A bird flies into the store carrying an issue of the comic. It scratches it to pieces and flies off.

MILHOUSE
Okay, so I made one bad decision.

BART
Oh, It's my fault for leaving you in charge. Sometimes I forget how young you are.

MILHOUSE
I'm only three months younger than you.

BART
Oh look, you're getting cranky - you haven't had your juice.

MILHOUSE
Well, my straw broke off in the carton... that's not the point! We're supposed to be partners, and you're pushing me around, like a play-school corn-popper.

BART
(sniggers) It's a vacuum cleaner, Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Whatever! I demand respect! I have feelings! I'm a human boy, just like you!!

BART
Shhh. Use your indoor voice.

MILHOUSE
Okay, that's it!

He steps back and removes is glasses. Realizing he cannot see anything, he puts them back on, and lunges at Bart. The scene freezes as a frame from a comic book. Milhouse is in the air, with a speech bubble saying "AIEEEE!" Bart is looking to the side, with a smaller bubble saying "SIGH..." Both of them are drawn with muscles.



ACT THREE

The scene continues. The frame from the comic book unfreezes, and Milhouse kicks Bart into a shelf on the other side of the store. Bart picks up a Transformer robot toy, and transforms it into an axe.

BART
On guard!

Milhouse also picks up a Transformer toy. However, this one transforms into... a watering can.

MILHOUSE
Oh...

The boys begin fighting. Soon, Milhouse has Bart cornered.

MILHOUSE
Eat watering can, partner!

Just as he swings his weapon, they both fall through a poster on the wall, down a flight of stairs, into a secret room, filled with video tapes. There is a chair in the middle of the room, and a television and VCR on one wall, amongst the shelves.

BART
Whoa!

MILHOUSE
Comic Book Guy's secret stash!

BART
Look at all these bootleg videos! (reading the labels) "Alien Autopsy", "Illegal Alien Autopsy", "Godfather III - Good version".

MILHOUSE
He's got the tape of Kent Brockman picking his nose. (he puts the tape into the VCR) Look! He's picking his nose!

Comic Book Guy is at Principal Skinner's house, waiting for Agnes.

AGNES
(from upstairs) I'll be right down! 'm just putting on my witch-hazel. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

COMIC BOOK GUY
(to Skinner) So... your mother tells me you go to Springfield Elementary.

SKINNER
Exactly what is your interest in my mother?

COMIC BOOK GUY
She makes me laugh.

AGNES
Here I come!

She slides down the banister.

SKINNER
Good lord mother! I can see your... (covering his mouth) figure.

AGNES
Oh, you see more when you do my daily mole check.

SKINNER
(aside, to Agnes) What I do for my allowance money is (indicating Comic Book Guy) nobody's business.

AGNES
He's not nobody. He might even be your new daddy.

Agnes and Comic Book Guy walk out, laughing. Skinner is left blubbering.

Bart and Milhouse settle down for more bootleg video viewing.

MILHOUSE
"Police Informant Tape"? These are never supposed to leave the station!

The tape shows Ned Flanders sitting at in an interrogation room with Chief Wiggum.

FLANDERS
I really hate to be a snitch.

WIGGUM
Don't worry. Your yellow-bellied ratting will be held in the strictest of confidence.

FLANDERS
Well, in that case, my neighbor Homer released a radioactive ape into my house. It's taken over the whole top floor!

BART
(explaining to Milhouse) It wasn't Dad's fault, the ape tricked him. What's next?

MILHOUSE
"Mr. Rogers" drunk.

He put the tape in. Mr. Rogers' voice is heard.

MR. ROGERS
(slurring his speech) What do you mean I can't take of my sweater? I'm hot!

MILHOUSE
You know, I'll bet kids would pay to see this stuff. We could have a midnight screening right here is the store.

BART
(gasps) That's actually a great idea, Milhouse.

MILHOUSE
Really? Well, I was due.

BART
I'll say... partner.

Homer and Marge visit the Squidport.

MARGE
So many restaurants.

HOMER
Oh, I can't decide! I throw myself upon the mercy of the food court!

MARGE
(approaching one) Um, I guess I'll have the Chicken Tandoori.

HOMER
(at a different stall) And I'll have the Beef Wellington.

We see that underneath the stalls, a man puts the same "All-Purpose Meat" onto different ramps, serving each restaurant. Back up top, Homer and Marge meet Comic Book Guy and Agnes.

MARGE
Oh, look at you two. You look so "couple-y"

COMIC BOOK GUY
Yes, well we're a perfect match. Her sneer just lights up my day.

AGNES
And we're always finishing each other's insults.

Their date is played out to "Puppy Love" by Paul Anka. Comic Book Guy and Agnes take a walk, destroying fun of children wherever they go. Comic Book Guy turns off an open fire hydrant in which kids are playing, and skims a stone over a lake, sinking a boy's toy boat. They then sit looking at the sunset.

AGNES
Sunsets. Thank God there's only one of these a day.

COMIC BOOK GUY
Could it be any more orange?

A banner outside The Androids Dungeon reads "Forbidden Film Festival - $5". Inside, dozens of kids gather for the screening.

BART
I must warn you that when this next tape starts, it will not stop... because that button is broken.

MILHOUSE
Let's watch.

The video is a black and white defense briefing. A general is sat at a desk.

GENERAL
If you're watching this tape, you are the President of the United States. Hello, sir, or ma'am. Hopefully sir.

BART
Got that right!

He high-fives Milhouse. On the tape, the general walks over to a map of Springfield.

GENERAL
Springfield has been classified "NWB," for "Nuclear Whipping Bhoy." In the first moments of a nuclear war, Springfield will be bombed at will by all friendly nations to calibrate their missiles. (the kids cheer) Now for total security, I will terminate the cameraman.

He pulls out a pistol, and shoots the cameraman.

CAMERAMAN
Thanks a lot, Steve!

He falls off camera. The kids cheer, but not for long. Suddenly, the police enter the room through the poster.

WIGGUM
All right, this is a raid!

Several kids try to dive out of the room by running into posters on the wall, but just hit their heads.

WIGGUM
Well, well, well! This place has got more pirated tapes than a...

LOU
A Chinese K-Mart?

WIGGUM
Well, that'll have to do. Are these yours, son?

MILHOUSE
No sir. We're just exhibiting them for profit without permission.

WIGGUM
Fair enough. But the owner is in more hot water than...

LOU
A Japanese tea bag?

WIGGUM
Why don't you lay off the Asians, Lou?

Comic Book Guy and Agnes make love in his apartment.

COMIC BOOK GUY
 Well, you've changed me, Agnes. Maybe there is room in my store for romance comics.

AGNES
Nobody will buy those. Your store smells. Now kiss me, funny face.

The police break down the door.

WIGGUM
All right... oh! Dear God! Cover your eyes boys!

Eddie turns away and throws up. Lou comforts him.

LOU
It's okay, man. It doesn't affect you. You're not human.

WIGGUM
Comic Book Guy, you're under arrest for the possession of illegal videos. (covering his eyes) But we'll reduce your sentence if you put your pants on - fast! God!

LOU
Come on, Romeo.

COMIC BOOK GUY
They can't lock me up for long, Agnes. Will you wait for me?

AGNES
Are you crazy? My bones are half dust!

The Androids Dungeon is cordoned off. Bart and Milhouse walk down the street.

MILHOUSE
Well, we may not have the store, but at least we're friends again.

BART
Yup. And, we haven't been to school in days and days and days.

MILHOUSE
Oh well, looks like everything's back to normal.

Just then, Flanders' car passes them. Ned is driving, with the radioactive ape in the passenger's seat. The ape smacks him.

FLANDERS
Look, if you want me to turn, just point. (the ape smacks him again) Ow! It's one way! (another smack) Ow! Now what was that for? (smack) Ow! (smack) Ow! (smack) Ow!

Fade to credits.


#### SET 16 ####
ACT ONE

The Simpsons eat dinner in the kitchen. Marge calls everyone's attention.

MARGE
Alright family! Who can guess what's different about dinner tonight?

HOMER
(looks at food) Eh, same old garbage!

The rest of the family laugh.

BART
This guy's always on!

MARGE
Oh, you two! We're eating genetically modified vegetables. Look how big they are!

HOMER
(picking up corn) This corn doesn't look so big.

MARGE
That's baby corn.

HOMER
(shocked) Wha-aat!?

LISA
American corporations should stop playing God with nature.

MARGE
There's nothing to be afraid of. They're all grown by the vegetable division of Union Carbide

LISA
Mom, my potato is eating a carrot! (her potato seems to be alive, and chomping on a carrot)

MARGE
That's it, from now on I'm growing all our vegetables myself.

Out in the garden, Marge plants some seeds. As she walks away, crows swoop down on the vegetable patch. Marge swings the hoe at them.

MARGE
Go away, go away!

Later, Marge pushes a wooden cross into the patch.

LISA
What you doin', Mom?

MARGE
I've tried heckling them, I've tried jeckling them, it's time I made myself a scarecrow.

Marge takes clothes out of a box, laying them on the floor in the shape of a body. Captions featuring Comic Book Guy pop up on screen for each item: 'Lisa's jersey from "Lisa on Ice"', 'Bart's jockey pants from "Saddlesore Galactica"', 'Jack-o-lantern from "Treehouse of Horror III, IX, XII"', and 'Grampa's Hat from "Who Shot Grampa's Hat?"'. Marge goes outside and sees something is on the vegetable patch again. She picks up the broom.

MARGE
Go away, go away!

It turns out the Flanders are praying in front of the cross stuck in the patch. Marge waves the broom at them.

NED
God, the father almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth...

MARGE
Shoo, shoo!

NED
Ahh! (They run off, but come back when Marge has gone.) Heaven and Earth... where were we? Now I'm lost...

The crows are on the patch again. Marge has put all the clothes on the scarecrow, except for the hat. When she puts it on, the crows notice and fly off, scared.

MARGE
Yeah I did it! Marge is in the house! Or I will be soon, 'cause it needs some cleaning!

That night, Homer returns from work, and sees the shadow of the scarecrow from the front lawn.

HOMER
Aah! Aah! (runs off) I'll regroup at Red Lobster...

Sometime later, Homer returns, armed with a baseball bat. He sneaks up on the scarecrow and batters it.

HOMER
You ain't pretty no more...

The crows fly back, landing on Homer's arms.

HOMER
Ah, look, I've made some friends. Now go do my bidding! Uh, whatever it may be.

The crows fly off and return with a bag of potato chips, a mug of beer, a sandwich and a copy of Playdude. Next, Homer is at Moe's, surrounded by crows. Moe and the other bar flies look a little nervous.

HOMER
So Lisa says by killing their enemy I became the alpha crow.

MOE
I gotta admit, I'm kinda nervous here. We haven't seen Barney since they enveloped him.

HOMER
I'm sure he'll turn up. Look here's one of his buttons (holds up a button, dripping with blood)

MOE
Alright, that's it, get 'em outa here! This ain't no crow-bar. (reaching under the bar) This is a crow-bar. (pulls out a picture with crows in a bar) See? They got the little stools... and everything?

Back at home, Homer and Marge are in bed. Homer points out all the crows to Marge.

HOMER
That's Russel Crowe, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Jim Crow-nan, Gregory Peck...

A crow flies out of Marge's hair.

MARGE
Hmm... Homer, I'm very uncomfortable about having a gang of crows in our bedroom.

HOMER
It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder.

MARGE
I'm sleeping on the couch.

She leaves. The next day, Homer relaxes in the hammock. A crow bites off a bit of his donut and tries to feed it to him, but makes him choke.

HOMER
Drop it in, don't cram it in! Oh forget it, I'll do it myself. (looks up to Maggie's bedroom window) Ah, look, Maggie wants to fly too! (the crows fly into the room and pick her up) Hey, cut it out! Put her down!

Maggie slips out of her clothes. She pulls off her diaper and uses it as a parachute. Homer catches her.

HOMER
Oh, thank God you're okay! (puts her down and turns to the crows) Okay, that was not cool! We need to lay down some ground rules. (the crows squawk) We'll get to that, right now I think we need some time apart. (crows squawk more) Alright that's it! (picks up broom) Shoo you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

The crows get angry and attack him. Homer screams.

HOMER
That is not a worm! (screams some more)



ACT TWO

At the hospital, Dr. Hibbert stitches Homer's eyes.

HOMER
Ow, ow! I hate getting stitches in my eyes! Stupid crows.

DR. HIBBERT
Don't feel bad for the crows, Homer. They weren't trying to blind you, they were just trying to drink your sweet, sweet eye juices.

HOMER
(calmly) Hmm, fascinating. Say, Doctor, can you do something about my (hysterical) SEARING PAIN!?

DR. HIBBERT
Well, there is medication, although it is a little... controversial.

HOMER
Does it go in the butt?

DR. HIBBERT
I'm talking about medicinal marijuana. Prescription pot. Texas THC.

HOMER
Look man, I don't do drugs.

DR. HIBBERT
Homer, for your eyes, the best tonic is chronic. You're not afraid, are you?

HOMER
I had a bad experience with drugs. It was that golden weekend between summer school and regular school.

We flashback to a playing field at a school. Lenny and Carl (complete with afros) are smoking weed.

LENNY
Hey Homer, wanna smoke some marijuana?

CARL
They say it's a gateway drug.

Homer takes the joint and is about to smoke it, when they hear Chief Wiggum.

WIGGUM
Well, well, if it isn't the doobie brothers.

LENNY
Uh-oh. (quietly to Homer) Crotch the weed, man.

Homer does so. Wiggum approaches with a dog.

WIGGUM
Smell any drugs, Sergeant Scraps?

The dog smells the weed in Homer's pants, grabs him by his crotch, and swings him back and forth. We return to the present.

HOMER
For me, the sixties ended that day in 1978.

DR. HIBBERT
But Homer, you can't let a single bad experience scare you away from drugs.

HOMER
But isn't marijuana, or "dope", illegal?

DR. HIBBERT
Only for those who enjoy it. Medical use of marijuana is legal in this state. We'll also provide you with a prescription bong. (chuckling) Do you want the wizard, or the skull?

Homer returns home and opens his starter pack.

HOMER
Okay, lets see... (reads container) "Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."

Homer lights the joint and starts to smoke it. A few moments later, we see that smoke has filled the hallway. Marge and the kids are in the living room.

MARGE
(noticing the smoke) What's that billowing down the stairs? (gasp) It's smoke!

LISA
(sniffing the air) It smells like the art teacher's office.

We hear Homer singing a Deep Purple song from the bedroom.

HOMER
Smoke on the water! Da da da, da da da-da...

MARGE
Uh-oh.

She rushes upstairs and the kids follow her. While Homer keeps singing, Marge tries to open the door.

HOMER
They burned down the gambling house,
It died with an awful sound.
I am hungry for a candy bar,
I think I'll eat a Mounds."

Marge has no luck opening the door, so Bart steps in with his trusty credit card and picks the lock. They all gasp when they see Homer smoking.

MARGE
Homer, you're doing drugs! (swipes the joint, then gasps) Now I'm guilty of possession. I could go to prison! Unless I testify against you!

HOMER
Marge, it's making my eyes better. And it's legal. I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face, and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it!

The next morning, Homer gets up, high again. To the tune of "Wear You Love Like Heaven" by Donovan, he picks up his shaver and it smiles at him. He shaves, and rainbows spurt out from his face. As he gets into his car it winks at him, then he flies off into the distance against a brightly-coloured skyline. Back at home, Marge receives a phone call. It's Homer.

MARGE
Hello?

HOMER
Marge, I just realized, I am the "ow", in the word "now". And if you tell anyone...

MARGE
Honey, I like it when you call, but we just talked five minutes ago. (phone beeps) Hang on, I've got call waiting. Hello?

HOMER
Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.

Marge groans. Later, Homer is in Lisa's room, listening to her playing her saxophone. He chuckles. Bart enters.

BART
Dad, I thought you didn't like her saxophone.

HOMER
I didn't, but now, Daddy's special medicine... (menacingly) which you must never use, because it will ruin you life! (calmly) ... lets Daddy see and hear magical things that you will never experience... (menacingly) ever!

LISA
Dad, it's 1 a.m. and I'm out of saliva.

HOMER
Shh! Shh! Shh!

He gives her some money, and Lisa drops it in her saxophone case, which is already overloaded with notes. Lisa continues playing.

HOMER
(thinking) Wow, that saxophone would make a great pipe.

Ned Flanders turns up on the Simpsons' doorstep. Homer opens the door.

NED
Hi-diddly-hey, Homer!

HOMER
Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders. You got the moustache, and the "diddly"... okay, now do Wiggum.

NED
(chuckling) Homer, it me, Ned.

HOMER
Oh right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you. (pulls out a piece of paper) "Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that he himself could not eat it?"

NED
Well sir, of course, he could, but then again... wow, as melon-scratchers go that's a honey-doodle.

HOMER
Now you know what I've been going through.

NED
Well luckily I've got a book right here that's jam-packed with answers.

He pulls out a Bible and gives it to Homer, who leafs through it.

HOMER
Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?

NED
(excited gasp) I guess that could be arranged.

Some time later, Flanders finishes...

NED
The grace of the lord Jesus be with God's people. The end.

HOMER
Whoa. Whoa. God does so much for me and he doesn't ask anything in return.

NED
Well I know he's wishing you to sign this petition... to re-criminalize medicinal marijuana.

HOMER
(signs it) Done and done. Now do Wiggum!

NED
Well okay, I guess it would go something like this... (Wiggum's voice) Alright Simpson, you're under arrest, see?

HOMER
I said Wiggum!

At the power plant. In his office, Burns reads his speech aloud to Smithers.

BURNS
And so, potential investors, I hope you'll think our I.P.O. is an I.P.U. (chuckles) Then I hold my nose thusly. (holds nose) What do you think Smithers?

SMITHERS
A bit of a downer, sir.

BURNS
Well I hope the investors like it. I have to raise sixty million dollars or we're out of business.

SMITHERS
Why is that, sir?

BURNS
I told you, I pissed it away! Oh don't make that face. (looks at Smithers) Yes, that's the one. Smithers, I need someone that laughs at all my jokes. You know, honest feedback.

Homer walks into Burns' office (still high).

HOMER
Whoops, I though this was the can, man. (laughs)

BURNS
Well, you're a happy Homer. What's your name, young man?

HOMER
You just said it! (laughs again)

BURNS
(walks over to him) Well if you liked that, listen to this. Working hard, or hardly working? (Homer laughs harder) Smithers, you could learn a thing of two from this bray moron. (chuckles) Young man, I'm making you my Executive Vice President.

SMITHERS
Sir, I believe that position was informally promised to me.

BURNS
Oh Smithers, I would have said anything to get your stem cells. (to Homer) Now, welcome aboard.

HOMER
(touches Burns face) You're covered with a very fine fuzz.

Homer returns home in a company car. As he walks to the front door, he chuckles.

HOMER
Hehehe, hardly working...

He opens the front door. Marge is waiting for him.

MARGE
Where did you get that suit.

HOMER
Whoa! One question at a time! (points to Marge) Yes, you?

MARGE
Look, I'm really starting to worry, there's half-eaten cupcakes everywhere, we're all out of paper clips, and the curtains smell like doob.

HOMER
Yeah? Well I got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to "yes I cann-abis". (walks off screen) We have a kitchen?!

That night, Marge turns over in bed to find Homer not there. She hears a TV on somewhere.

TV
(woman's voice) Oh, now where are those three chandeliers hangers I hired? (smashing sound) (man's voice) You mutton-heads, this is why we can never hold down a job.

The noise is coming from the attic. Homer and Otto are watching this show, laughing.

HOMER
Look at shemp! He is so high!

OTTO
(chuckling) Hey, "shemp" is "hemp" spelled backwards!

HOMER
And "Otto" is "Otto" backwards! (laughs)

OTTO
Now I'm scared.

MARGE
Homie, I don't mean to nag, but what does this have to do with healing your eyes?

HOMER
As soon as I graduate I am so outa here!

The news comes on TV, hosted by Kent Brockman.

KENT
This just in, the marijuana re-criminalization initiative took another step forward today, as supporters collected the final signatures required to place it on the ballot for next Tuesday's election.

HOMER
We gotta get out and stop that initiative! Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.

OTTO
No guac' in mine.

MARGE
Good night, Homer. (leaves)

OTTO
Dude, your Mom is hot!

A protest rally is being held. The band Phish appear and play the first couple of lines from "Run Like An Antelope". They suddenly stop for something.

SINGER
Okay, okay, hold on, hold on. (sniffing the air) I smell marijuana smoke. That better be medicinal.

PIANIST
If Phish don't see a prescription slip, we are outa here!

DRUMMER
We can wait all night, people.

Hans Moleman (wearing a psychedelic T-shirt) holds up his prescription slip.

DRUMMER
Here we go. (reads it) Whoa. This guy is seriously ill.

HANS MOLEMAN
My doctor never told me that. I had to hear it from Phish.

SINGER
A-one, a-two, a-you know what to do.

They continue with their song. A little while later, they incorporate the Simpsons theme tune into their set.

PIANIST
Thank you! And now, a man who's a real po-thead... I'm sorry, pot-head... Homer Simpson!

HOMER
Good afternoon. I wanna thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs... (crowd all mutter "Jobs?") Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal! (crowd cheer) Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented The Matrix, medical marijuana can make things fabulous! ...medically. (crowd cheer) So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the 7th...

GUITARIST
Uh, Homer... that was yesterday.

Homer goes to a newspaper-dispenser and buys a newspaper.

HOMER
Oh man, they already voted! And we lost! (crowd groan) Oh man I can't believe we spaced on the date!

OTTO
Well, what are we gonna do?

HOMER
Well we can't just stand here staring at our hands. Although... (looks at hands) Wow!

OTTO
(sees ring on finger) Whoa! Oh, that's right, I married that chick.

Everyone leaves. That night, Homer and Otto are still on the stage.

OTTO
They call 'em fingers, but I never see them 'fing'. Oh, there they go.



ACT THREE

The police burn off remaining marijuana.

WIGGUM
There we go, dump all that medical marijuana on there.

Lou and Eddie do so, and the crowd inhale the smoke.

WIGGUM
Actually, that smoke is a little too inviting. Uh, throw on that sack of barber hair.

They do so, and the crowd cough and splutter. Homer watches from his living room window.

HOMER
Oh, I could have smoked that pot... and worn that hair.

MARGE
Homer, you don't need drugs anymore, your eyes are all better.

HOMER
Eyes? What the Hell are you talking about?

LISA
I want my old Dad back, the one who was yelling all the time and... you know, I'm not really sure what I want.

MARGE
Homer, it's over. I want you to look at your children and promise them you will never do drugs again.

HOMER
Alright, I'll do it for my kids.

BART
As long as you're doing things for me, would you tie up your bath robe when you walk around the house?

HOMER
Never!

In the attic, Homer packs away all his pot-related stuff (bongs etc.)

OTTO
I can still crash here, right?

HOMER
Get out.

OTTO
Hey, remember when I dropped my keys and you thought the phone was ringing?

HOMER
Oh yeah... (chuckling) Get out.

At Moe's. Homer sighs.

MOE
What's the matter, Homer? You're like drunk, but you're not sloppy-drunk.

HOMER
Going cold turkey isn't as delicious a it sounds.

MOE
I'm really glad you're off the wacky tobaccy.

LENNY
Yeah, you were getting all spacey and everything. We were going to have an intervention.

CARL
Yeah, but at the planning party, I got alcohol poisoning. I nearly died!

They laugh.

MOE
I was already making excuses not to go to your funeral.

They laugh again. Back at home, the family eat dinner.

HOMER
It's been three days and my mind is clearer. My sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shape and patterns.

LISA
Dad, you just said that three minutes ago.

HOMER
Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this. (pulls out a joint)

MARGE
Why are you keeping that thing?

HOMER
As a reminder, Marge.

The joint says "Dentist -Tuesday" on the side. The phone rings and Homer answers. It's Burns.

HOMER
Hello?

BURNS
A-hoy hoy, executive V.P. I'm putting the final touches on my speech to the investors, and I need your generous guffaws.

HOMER
But I can't find you funny anymore.

BURNS
I'll either tickle your ribs or feed them to my dogs! Now we're ordering out, what do you want in your pizza pie? ... Extra cheese?! What do you take me for? Lorenzo DeMerichee?! See you soon.

Homer is about to leave.

MARGE
Don't worry Homie, you don't need Mary-Jane to laugh at Mr. Burns' jokes. Just... picture him naked! (Homer screams) Or... uh, um, with a funny hat on!

Homer screams louder and falls to the floor. Later he is Burns' mansion.

BURNS
So, profits will be as thinner than... (chuckling) Louise Brooks negligee!

Homer and Smithers have big grins on their faces, but neither laugh.

BURNS
You know, Louise Brooks, the silent star of Lulu?

SMITHERS
(whispering to Homer) One of us has gotta start laughing. If Mr. Burns gets flop sweat he'll die of dehydration.

Burns gets a drop of sweat on his forehead and starts to feel giddy.

BURNS
Oh, I'm drenched with sweat. (pushes the sweat back in) I'm going to take a bath-yola, and when I come back, you'd better be laughing.

Burns leaves. Homer pulls out his joint.

HOMER
This stuff can make anything funny, even that show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.

SMITHERS
Well, I gotta do something.

HOMER
Start inhalin', Waylon.

Sometime later, Smithers is high, and wearing a suit.

SMITHERS
This suit used to belong to Judy Garland. Uh, we could sing a song, if you don't mind being Mickey Rooney.

HOMER
You mean that guy on "60 Minutes" who yells all the time?

SMITHERS
Sixty minutes? Oh my God, Mr. Burns has been in the tub for an hour!

They rush into the bathroom to see Burns floating face down in the bathtub. They both scream. Smithers pulls him out of the tub.

SMITHERS
Oh, Mr. Burns. You were too beautiful for this world.

He hugs him and Burns slips out of his hands like soap and flies into the wall.

HOMER
Oh man, we killed Mr. Burns! Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad!

SMITHERS
The investors meeting is in twenty minutes.

HOMER
So what? Mr. Burns is dead!

SMITHERS
We can carry on. Michael Eisner's been dead for five years, Ted Turner's just a hologram. Now, we gotta think...

At the investors meeting Bill Clinton introduces.

CLINTON
So, when somebody says I was an embarrassment to the country, I say "It depends on what the meaning of 'was' is, jerk." (chuckles) You owe me two hundred thousand dollars. Good night everybody!

He walks off, and Homer takes his place.

HOMER
Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a fox attitude. And now a man who you will see as definitely... not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!

The curtains open and Burns appears, sat in a chair. He has strings attached to him and Smithers controls his movement from the gallery like a puppet.

HOMER
Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip you speech and go directly to the questions?

Smithers makes Burns nod. Dr. Nick stands up.

DR. NICK
Mr. Burns, a two-part question: One, when will you see a profit again, and two, what's that red stuff coming out of your ear?

HOMER
Mr. Burns, may I field that one? (Burns nods and smiles) It's true we're losing money. But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away!

Smithers makes Burns do a dance. The audience cheer. Suddenly, the strings break and Burns lands on the floor. The curtains close and Homer wraps up.

HOMER
Mr. Burns has left the building!

CROWD
(chanting) We are ovine! We are ovine!

Homer goes behind the curtain, where Burns is on the floor. Suddenly, he wakes up.

BURNS
Ah, brilliant. We lost sixty million dollars and they're cheering for more.

SMITHERS
Mr. Burns, you're alive!

BURNS
Yes, I regained consciousness during my big dance number. Those strings pulling me every which way jostled my heart from its slumber.

HOMER
(to Smithers) And you wanted to take him to the hospital.

BURNS
Oh and you didn't? Well, the worm has finally shown his fangs. Smithers, make me slap him.

Smithers pulls the string attached to Burns' arm and makes him slap Homer.

BURNS
You call that a slap? Make me slap you. (slaps Smithers) Now both (slaps both ) Now just you. (slaps Smithers) Now give me a taste. (slaps himself) Now both again. (slaps both, and fade to credits) Now all three (three slaps heard) Excellent...

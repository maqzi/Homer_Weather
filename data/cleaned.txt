There's no time to be careful, we're late.
Hey Norman, how is it going? So you got dragged out here too, huh?
How are you doing, Fred? Yeah. Excuse me. (he steps on someone's feet) Oops, pardon my galoshes.
Oh it's Lisa! That's ours.
Oh, How many grades does this school have?
Marge! Haven't you finished that stupid letter yet?
Marge!
Marge! Where's the extension cord?
Sorry I'm just a big kid. I love Christmas so much.
D'oh!
A what?
Yeah, if you want one, you'll have to pay for it out of your own allowance.
Hello?
Who is this?
This is her sister isn't it?
Who shall I say is calling?
(handing the phone to Marge) It's your sister.
Okay kids prepare to be dazzled. Marge, turn on the juice! What do you think kids?
What is it, Flanders?
Its too bright. (muttering) Flanders, what a big show off.
Tell us, Marge, where have you been hiding the Christmas money?
Oh, big jar this year!
Oh, thank god for the big jar.
Hey, what's this? (he touches Bart's arm)
Oh, its true! The jar is empty! Oh my god, we're ruined. Christmas is canceled, no presents for anyone.
Aah!
Oh, yeah... my Christmas bonus. Hee hee... how silly of me. This will be best Christmas yet. The best any family ever had!
Huh? Oh, I love you Marge.
Good, because I do love you. I don't deserve you as much as a guy with a fat wallet and a credit card that wont set off that horrible beeping.
Marge, let me be honest with you.
Well... I... I want to do the Christmas shopping this year!
Marge, Marge, mmm, lets see... oh, look! Pantyhose! Practical and alluring. A six pack, oh, only 4.99. Ooh, pads of paper. I bet Bart could think of a million things to do with these. That just leaves little Maggie... oh look, a little squeak toy! It says its for dogs, but she cant read.
Hello Flanders.
Well, lets see.
They're all yours!
(snatching it) Gimme that!
So?
Thanks Moe.
What's with the crazy get up, Barn?
Wow, can I do that?
What do you mean, all the time? Even when they're nuts? (the manager frowns at him) Uh, I certainly do!
Uh, when do we get paid?
Um, Dasher... Dancer...
Prancer...
Nixon... Comet... Cupid... Donna Dixon?
And what would you like, little boy?
Why you little...! (he tries to strangle the manager)
D'oh, I knew that one too.
Not a word Marge, I'm heading straight for the tub.
Why? Oh yeah. Hello Patty, hello Selma, how was your trip.
You both look well.
Yeah, well, Merry Christmas.
And why is that?
Well I was just on my way out to get one!
No!!
Uh-oh.
So, what do you think, kids? Beauty, isn't it?
Oh, that's an ornament.
Ah son, you don't need all that junk. I'm sure you already got something much more important: a decent home, and a loving father that would do anything for you. Hey, I cant afford lunch, give me a bite of that donut.
Oh, I will when Mrs. Clause's sisters get out of town. Thanks for listening kid.
What's your name Bart... ner... uh, little partner?
(angrily) I'm jolly old Saint Nick.
D'oh!
I want a word with you in Santa's Workshop little boy! (aside) Cover for me Alphy.
Nobody knows! Its a secret. I didn't get my bonus this year but to keep the family from missing out on Christmas I'd do anything.
Well lets not get mushy son, I still have a job to do. (leaves the workshop) Hey hey! Santa's back! Ho ho (he bangs his head) D'oh! Dammit!
Ah, son, one day you're going to learn the satisfaction of payday - receiving a big fat check for a job well done.
Come on son lets go cash this baby and get presents for... aah! Thirteen bucks? Hey wait a minute!
Yeah...
But...
Santa training?
Wait a minute...
But...
But...
Ohh...
Thirteen bucks? You can't get anything for thirteen bucks.
What?
Sorry Barney, I may be a total wash out of a father but I'm not going to take my kid to a sleazy dog track on Christmas Eve.
Uh-uh.
Well, okay lets go. (walking off) Who's Tiny Tim?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
Hey Barney, which one is Whirlwind?
What, that scrawny little bag of bones?
Yeah, you're right. I guess Whirlwind is our only hope for a Merry Christmas.
Bart did you here that? What a name - Santa's Little Helper. It's a sign. It's an omen.
(at the betting desk) What are the odds on Santa's Little Helper?
Wow! Ninety nine times thirteen equals... Merry Christmas!
Don't you believe in me son?
Come on boy, sometimes your face is all that keep me going.
That's my boy! (to the clerk) Everything on Santa's little Helper.
Come on Bart, kiss the ticket for good luck. Not that we need it!
D'oh! Oh...
Come on you stupid dog.
D'oh!
I don't want leave till I dog finishes. (long pause) Ah forget it, lets go.
Find any winners son?
Oh no you don't! No, no, get away from me! Uh-uh.
But he's a loser! He's pathetic! He's... (the dog licks Homer) ... a Simpson.
Look everybody, I have a confession to make.
I didn't get my Christmas bonus. I tried to not let it ruin Christmas for everybody, but no matter what I did...
It is?
Number 8. I mean, Santa's Little Helper.
Bart!
Lisa!
I'm warning you two!
Er... Rudolph, get your nose over here,
So you can drive my sleigh... today...
You little... grrrr!!
Boring!
I can't believe we're paying to see something we get on TV for free. (gesturing) If you ask me everyone in this theatre is a giant sucker. (points at camera) Especially you!
Well I hate going. Why can't I worship the Lord in my own way, by praying like hell on my death bed.
Relax! Those pious morons are too busy talking to their phoney-baloney God!
How ya doin'? Peace be with you. Praise Jebus.
(quietly, with fingers crossed) Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay...
This book doesn't have any answers!
Okay! Who want waffles?
I'll tell ya what happened: A certain someone had a senior moment. But that's okay, because we love him, and we got a free rug out of it. (kisses Grampa on the forehead)
I rest my case.
(returning) Oh. Right.
(reading) Take out hornet's nest.
Check. (reads) Fix sink hole.
Check. (reads) Reshingle roof?
Steady... steady...
Owww! Owww!
Why you little...! (strangles Bart) I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!
What kind of fun?
That sounds fun. I dare you to... climb the T.V. antennae.
Earthquake! Earthquake!
Aftershock! Aftershock!
(hammering the gutter) Shut up, Flanders!
Well said, boy. (They high-five, then Homer readies another nail for the gutter) Steady... steady... steady...
(hit with pellets) D'oh! D'oh! Why did I (hit with more pellets) suggest this? (hit with more pellets)
Alright boy, time for the ultimate dare. I dare YOU to skateboard to Krusty Burger - and back - naked!
Fourth base.
(taunting) Oh, I see. Then I hereby declare you 'chicken for life'. Every morning you'll wake up to "Good morning chicken!" At your wedding, I'll sing (he sings the wedding anthem in clucking noises; as Bart skateboard past him naked, he makes a surprised clucking sound).
What seems to be the problem, officers?
(getting out the car) And what happens to me if it's my fault?
It was all his idea! He's out of control I tell ya! Oh, I'm at my wit's end! (sobs)
Okay son, let's get some lunch.
Shirt, socks, everything you need.
Who am I, Tommy Bahama?
The worst day of your life so far.
Thank you.
Hey, what's with you?
Of course I do. What kind of father wouldn't care about (sees something) a pig wearing a hat!
(gasps) What? You can't kill him if he's wearing people clothes!
You're coming home with me.
Hey Marge! Isn't it great being married to someone who's recklessly impulsive?
Then say hello to the newest Simpson!
Oh, you're gonna love him! Look, he does and impression of you. (Homer pulls its tail and it squeals; Homer laughs) You nailed her. (Marge still looks worried) He also does me... (Homer squeezes him and he burps; Marge giggles) You smiled, I'm off the hook!
Oh, you have so many looks.
(in the bedroom again) Who's a good pig? (belly-kisses the pig) Who's a good pig? (belly-kisses the pig)
If you love fish like I do, you want them to die with dignity.
I think I have a nibble!
Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig,
Does whatever a Spider-Pig does,
Can he swing, from a web?
No he can't, he's a pig,
Look out! He is a Spider-Pig.
(to Spider-Pig) Don't get any ideas. (nudging him) Heh?
Maybe we should kiss, just to break the tension.
Nothing, nothing!
Don't worry, I've devised a most elegant solution.
It's not leaking, it's overflowing.
Well, I helped. (He heads back towards the house.)
(solemnly) Okay Marge, I will.
He's not Spider-Pig anymore, he's Harry Plopper.
(answering) Yello.
Oh my god oh my god oh my god! I just got one thing I gotta do first.
Uh-oh.
Drive, drive drive! (Plopper oinks) Oh, right.
Dooooooooooooooome!
(stepping away from Plopper) Act natural.
Mary Bailey. Well, if I was governor, I'd sure find better things to do with my time.
Like getting Washington's Birthday and Lincoln's Birthday back as separate paid holidays. "President's Day," pfft, what a rip-off! I bust my butt day in and day out--
So? Someone'll punch in for me.
I'll mutant you...
Oh man, plain cake donuts. (calling) Thanks for taking all the fancies, guys! (quietly to himself) Why can't I ever get here on time?
Aah! (starts pulling levers wildly) Uh, just resting my eyes!
Huh? What the-- (taps on window) Uh, Mr. Burns?
Aah! Sorry, sir, it's just me, Homer Simpson. Everything alright?
Uh, yes sir.
Ooh, cushy!
Well, nobody's perfect.
Y'know, I was just telling the wife that if I was governor, I'd do things a lot differently--
I bet you could afford it, though. (nervously) Don't get me wrong, I mean you're an honest man, I just mean that you could afford to run for governor if you felt like it. Of course I'm just rambling cause... because you keep staring at me like that, but, but it's true! I mean, if you were governor you could decide what's safe and what isn't...
Where are we going, sir?
If it's on the way, could you drop me off at my house?
Well, he's got my vote!
Mary Bailey isn't going to fire me if I don't vote for her. I'm for Monty Burns!
Oh, Marge. What's the big deal? I bet before the papers blew this all out of proportion you didn't even know how many eyes a fish had.
I hope Burns and I can count on your support, honey.
Oh yeah? Well I'm a Burns Booster! (pins button on) Ow!
Not yet, son.
Oh, great toast, Marge! Oh, by the way, the night before the election, Mr. Burns is coming over for dinner.
Oh, and some reporters and a camera crew, but you don't have to feed them.
Come on, Marge!
D'oh! Kids, pleases leave the room. I don't want you to see this.
Please please please please please please please please please please please please...
Marge! (to advisor) Don't worry. My daughter's very bright, and I'm sure she'll be able to memorize your question by dinnertime tomorrow.
Marge, get back in bed.
What's wrong? I just want to snuggle.
What's that got to do with it?
But you do get to express yourself! In the lovely home you keep, and the food you serve.
Huh?
Hey, hello handsome!
Bad dog! Bad... neighbor dog. Here, let me help you up, Mr. Burns.
Uh, are you alright, Mr. Burns?
Bart, would you like to say grace?
(with his mouth full, reading card) Um, you know, Mr. Burns, my family and I, um (Bart belches) feel that taxes are too high. Where do you stand on this highly controversial issue?
I was only reading what the card--
Uh, Mr. Burns? Mr. Burns?
Oh. My dreams will go unfulfilled? Oh, no! I don't like the sound of that one bit. That means I have nothing to hope for. Marge, make it better please, can't you make it better, huh?
Hey, you did it!
Chair goes round, chair goes round.
Yes.
Oh, I don't know. I'm kinda dizzy. I should probably go home sick.
Wow, you've got pencils with your name on them, just like a pencil company executive. I'd give anything for one of these.
Can I have this one?
Can... (thinks) Lenny have it?
I didn't even know what a nuclear panner plant was.
Hey, you seem like a great guy, so I'll give you a little tip. If you turn that security camera around, you can sleep and no one will ever know.
Oh yeah, they're always trying to screw ya.
Hiya Stretch, what's the good word?
Okay, Grimey.
Huh? (looks at the bag and chuckles) Oh, I'm sorry.
Check.
So, how's it going, Grimey?
(laughing) Wish I had a nickel every time I've heard that.
(singing) Take me out to the ball-game, take me out to the ball... Ah, what's new, Grimey?
(looks) Oh, a five THIR-teen. I'll handle it.
That got it.
Acid, eh? Jeez, that would've been stupid! (laughs) Boy would my face have been red. (laughs more)
(pointing to Grimes) He did.
(whispering to Grimes) He likes you.
Hi Grimey, old buddy.
(quietly) Okay. Do I have to do anything?
Oh, I can't believe it, I got an enemy. Me, the most beloved man in Springfield.
No, I won't accept that.
Oh, what'll I do, Moe?
Do you think it might work without the fork in the eye?
This dinner has to go absolutely perfect if Grimey and me are going to be friends. (turns to Lisa) Lisa, be perfect.
(to Marge) Marge. Perfect. (to Bart) Bart. Perfect. (to Maggie) Other kid. Perfect.
No. No. He doesn't know he's coming to dinner. I didn't think he'd come, so I called and said I had something really important to tell him and that I could only tell him about it here.
It's him! It's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him, it's him it's him!
(nervously) Welcome to the Simpson residence or "casa de Simpson," as I call it, heh heh.
It is, it is, but first, let me introduce you to my family, my perfect family. This is my wife Marge...
And our beautiful baby... (Maggie sucks her pacifier) ...my daughter Lisa, IQ a hundred and fifty six.
See? And my son Bart... (Bart winks) He owns a factory downtown.
I dunno. Don't as me how the economy works.
Wow!
Yes, that's me alright. And the guy standing next to me is President Gerald Ford. (pointing to the other photos) And this is when I was on tour with the Smashing Pumpkins. Oh! And here's a picture of me in outer space.
Sure. You've never been? Would you like to see my Grammy award? (holds it up)
What?
(gasps) What are you saying?
The car won't start. I don't feel very good today. I am at work.
That's crazy talk. You're crazy, Marge. Get off the road!
No he won't, he hates me.
Yeah, yeah, that's his problem, he's a nut! It's not about me being lazy, it's about him being a crazy nut.
I'll do it! (pulls out a bottle of Duff) To professionalism!
Good morning fellow employee. You'll notice that I am now a model worker. We should continue this conversation later during the designated break period. Sincerely, Homer Simpson.
Oh. Design your own power planet, eh? This is my chance to show everyone how professional I am. (to a picture of Lenny on his desk) Lenny, tell Mr. burns I've gone home to work on the contest.
(opens basement door) Marge, do we have any elbow macaroni and glue-on sparkles?
Well basically, I just copied the plant we have now.
Then, I added some fins to lower wind resistance. (pointing) And this racing stripe here I feel is pretty sharp.
Hey, you okay, Grimey?
(chuckles) You wish.
(snores) Change the channel, Marge!
It's just a movie, son. There's nobody that evil in real life.
I hope they kill that Iron Yuppie. Thinks he's so big.
Don't worry. We won a dental plan in the strike of '88. (indicating scar) That's where I got this scar.
Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? Where's my burrito? (awning collapses and hits him in the head) Ow!
Then I got this scar sneaking under the door of a pay toilet.
Thanks a lot, Carl. Now I've lost my train of thought.
(finally realizing) If we give up our dental plan... I'll have to pay for Lisa's braces! (to everyone) People, stop! We can't give up our Dental Plan! Lenny, without the dental plan, you wouldn't have that diamond in your tooth.
And Gummy Joe, where would you be without the Dental Plan?
You know what I think of this contract? This!
Hey, what does this job pay?
D'oh!
Woo-hoo!
And make life-long connections to the world of organized crime. Mmm... organized crime...
(tries it) Mmm... graci
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah. (takes a donut) Molto bene.
That's a nice a-donut.
Well, that depends on who's a better negotiator: Mr. Burns or me.
(trading) Done and done. (chuckles, then he realizes) D'oh!
Hey Lenny, can you get this Sugar Daddy off my back?
(thinking) Why is Mr. Burns being so nice to me?
(thinking) Wait a minute. Is he coming onto me?
(thinking) Oh my God! He is coming onto me!
(thinking) Aah! (aloud) Sorry, Mr. Burns, but I don't go in for these backdoor shenanigans. Sure, I'm flattered, maybe even a little curious, but the answer is no!
Who is it?
Who?
(opening door) Hired Goons?
Y'know, you could have just called me.
Hired Goons?
Gee, it's not as nice as the other rooms.
(thinking) Oh, man. I really have to go to the bathroom. Why did I have all that beer and coffee and watermelon?
Ooh, which way to the bathroom?
Nope. Nope. Nope.
Uh... yeah...
Ugh, I'm going to resign. I don't know why they made me union president in the first place.
Yeah, you're right. Guys are always patting my bald head for luck, pinching my belly to hear my girlish laugh.
You know, I think you're right. First thing tomorrow morning, I'm going to punch Lenny in the back of the head.
Fellow workers, I've been meeting with Mr. Burns day and night, and I've had enough.
Who keeps saying that?
Aah!!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
We're goin' back to work!
Lobo... Lobo... Bring back Sheriff Lobo... Lobo... Lobo! (waking up with a jolt) Aaah!
Oh no! Burns' birthday!
Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday, all the employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
(hit by Burns) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Missed me, heh heh! (hit) Ow.
Not funny! And the one in my pant really hurts!
(chuckling) Hee hee hee, I'm so funny. This is gonna be great!
I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poopoo one word or two?
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. (chuckles) I paint a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants!
Now, I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
Lisa, don't spoil our fun.
Okay, stupid!
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. (outside) Hey Flanders! You smell like manure!
(loudly) Are you ready to laugh?
(loudly) I said, are you ready to laugh?
You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap!
I mean, y'know, Mr. Burns is so old!
(to himself) Whoo, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. (to audience) Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find a little... cheeky!
(mimicking) I'm Mr. Burns! Blah blah blah! I think I'm so big, blah blah blah! Do this, do that, blah blah blah!
Bla bla bla-- (a guard hits him) Ow!
Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.
Don't worry boy, she'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down. (he gasps) Moldy? Old? I'm gonna get something to eat!
Ah! D'oh! Ow! Son of a... D'oh! Stupid... stair!
(gasp) How long have we had these fish? (gasp) Wait, it's a bear... Burns' bear!
Well Burns isn't getting this back cheap. He's gonna have to give me... my own recording studio.
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun... (starts to drool) oh...
(in a trance) Yes, we'll send the eye.
Yes, sir. (pan up to his brain) Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
Sorry, Burns, no deal!
I gotta call Burns, I gotta call Burns! Maybe I can still get that drink!
Right, that makes sense.
I knew you'd come crawling back.
A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands. Good ones, not the leper one.
Woohoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya! Here you go!
(struggling) It seems to be caught on something... Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
Here you go, Maggie. The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.
Big deal! Who needs his money? We're getting along fine.
Mmm... sixty four slices of American cheese. (starts eating them) Sixty four... sixty three...
Two... One...
I think I'm blind.
Wha?
(bored) Right here.
Oh, my life can't get any worse.
D'oh!
(whip) Ow! (whip) D'oh! After lunch, can I whip you?
Oh, no fair. (whip) Ow!
Maggie, I know you like the bear, but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... (looks around, and picks up a cardboard box) this box! (plays with it) See Maggie? See the fun box? Do-do-do-do-do-do!
No! My box! My box!
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns' money.
Aw, thanks Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured sole. (he picks up his box) Hee boxy!
Aw...
(chuckling) I can see why this show is so popular. Look at him. Heh.
Aah!
That's right.
Oh Barney, leave me alone!
Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out Smithers!
Heh heh. I love this show.
Well, well, look who's come to apologize.
But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear, it's Maggie's.
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?
D'oh! D'oh!
Ooh, pure genius!
And now to make the leap from dreams to reality!
Alright, stay calm. Remember your training.
"Dear Homer, I owe you one emergency donut. Signed, Homer." Bastard! He's always one step ahead. Oh... I'd sell my sould for a donut!
Flanders! You're the devil!?
Do you have a donut or not?
(with his mouth full) Hey wait. If I don't finish this last bite, you don't get my soul, do you?
(taunting) I'm smarter than the devil! I'm smarter than the devil!
Not likely, heh heh.
Mmm... forbidden donut...
Aah!
(weakly) No.
Ah, that wasn't so bad.
Uh-huh.
More.
No.
Woohoo! (jumps and burns his head on the cage) Ow!
Oh, but I'm so sweet and tasty! (looks at his watch) Oh, well, time to go to work.
Marge, look at all this great stuff I found at the marina. It was just sitting in some guy's boat!
Hey boy! (honks horn)
Aah! They're dogs... and they're playing poker! (screams and runs off)
(chuckling) Lisa, Vampires are make-believe, just like Elves, Gremlins and Eskimos.
Hmm... business deal.
It sure was nice of Mr. Burns to invite us for midnight dinner in his country house in... (creepily) Pennsylvania!
(pulling out a filthy cloth) Sure did!
Yeah, his hairdo looks so queer.
It was the boy!
Ooh, punch!
Correction: free blood!
Lisa, you and your stories. Bart is a vampire. Beer kills brain cells. Now lets go back to that building... thingy... where our beds and TV... is.
Bart! How many times have I told you not to bite your sis-- (realizes) wait a minute, you are a vampire!
Kill my boss?! Do I dare live out the American dream?
(sees sign for slide and gets excited) Super Fun Happy Slide!
Oh, I guess killing will be fun enough.
Take that, vile fiend!
(chuckling) Oh, sorry.
Whew!
D'oh!
You have to kill the head vampire!
(Walks into the store) Woohoo! Cheap meat! (picks it up) Ooh, this one's open.
Stomach...churning! (eats more) Bowels...clenching! Not much time... (falls off the couch) ...must...finish...
Your old meat made me sick!
(holds one up and sniffs it) This shrimp isn't frozen! And it smells funny!
Woohoo!
That dog can sell anything.
(stomach growls again) Oh, rancid meat attack! Stupid parasites. Is there no way I can find justice?
Boring!
Shh! Lisa, the dog is barking.
No way, man. No way, man! Get yourself another patsy, man. No way am I wearing a freakin' wire!
Oh, that I'll wear.
Don't be alarmed, Apu. Just go about your daily routine like I'm not wearing the hat.
Bee? Aah!
One hot dog, please. (eats it)
Oh, oh, stop!
(laughing hard) It's true, it's true! We're so lame!
No, don't kill me! I didn't know there was film in that camera in that hat! I was unaware. I was unaware! (sobs)
Oh.
You're selling what, now?
You can't sell that! Karma can only be portioned out by the cosmos. (slams door)
Is he still out there?
What? That's your job! If he starts doing Lisa's wood chopping--
Okay, okay, I'll let him. But then I get a Chipwich, okay?
(wolfing it down) Stop being such babies. You can't be afraid to try new things. For instance, tonight I'm using a-- Apu, what do you call this thing again?
(laughing) Outrageous!
Aah!
Uh... I like to keep a lollipop there.
Pass the chutney.
(shudders) Oh, that's even worse than the album Grampa released.
Well, you deserve it. All these vegetables are really clearing the cholesterol out of the old heart.
(in a trance) Uh. Apu friend me good.
(spoken) Heh heh, that's okay.
The Kwik-E-Mart is real... D'oh!
(sighs) Everything really wrapped up nicely. (looks at watch) Hmm, much quicker than usual.
And we've all found happiness, every one of us.
Hey, what's that sound?
Hey, he's not happy at all. He lied to us through song! I hate when people do that!
I'm coming with you. I got you fired, it's the least I can do. Well, the least I can do is absolutely nothing, but I'll go you one better and come along!
Okay.
I'm aware of that!
D'oh!
Are we in India yet?
Are we in India yet?
Are we in India yet?
Are we in India yet?
This isn't very convenient.
Are you really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
Really?
You?
(outside the store) Well, that was a big bust. Is he really the head of the Kwik-E-Mart?
No need to apologize, Apu. It was as much my fault as it was yours.
(choked) Okay, Apu! I accept your apology!
Fine! (Apu scowls) Oh, I mean, not good.
Apu, if it'll make you feel any better, I've learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
Hey, let's all hug Apu!
Hey, there's still time. Let's hug him again!
Whoo! Don't try to eat these so-called 'chips'.
Huh? Oh, okay, I'll take three.
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! Uh, I mean, woohoo.
Oh, I was bluffing.
Something was said, not good. What was it? Don't yell at Homer? Nah, that's okay. What was it... slow! They called you slow!
(standing up and pointing) How dare you call me that! I--
Something said, not good.
So anyhoo, last night we were playing poker, right. As usual I'm winning and not realizing it. And Lenny says that I'm... get this... he he... a little slow! (he roars with laughter, then stops) How come you're not laughing? Do you think I'm slow?
You think I don't want to? It's those TV networks, Marge, they won't let me. One quality show after another, each one fresher ad more brilliant than the last. If they only stumbled once, just gave us thirty minutes to ourselves! But they won't! They won't let me live! (He sobs.)
Oh, who am I kidding? I am slow.
Take another bath in malt liquor?
Oh. And how is 'education' supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home wine-making course and I forgot how to drive?
And how.
Wait a minute, even Lenny is teaching a class. Look at the way they admire and adore him. That's it! If he can teach a class, HE can teach a class! I mean I can teach a class!
Well, I can tell the difference between butter and 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter'.
Oh, I failed again! Everybody can teach a class but me! I'm an idiot! What am I going to tell my wife and kids?
(suggestively) That depends. Is there another way to get this job?
I'll do it! Anything to get me out of that house, away from all that nagging, and noise... uh, of a family of love. Tra-la-la-la!
Look everyone! Now that I'm a teacher I've sewn patches on my elbows.
Ah, incorrect, Marge. Two perfectly good jackets.
(pause) Yes Lisa, Daddy's a teacher.
Can't talk now, I've got a class to teach!
Nothing for me today, I've got a class to teach!
It's all right, I'm a teacher!
All right, the first thing they told me to do is make sure everyone here is in the right class.
Ew! Down the hall, room twelve.
Ew! Okay, let's get started. Uh... Um... Um... Um...
No talking! (he coughs) Um... Um... Oh! Um... Um...
Yeah... yeah! That'll eat up some time. How about you... (scans the room) Otto?
Huh? Oh yeah, I was listening. Very funny.
Yes, to the untrained eye, I'm eating an orange. But to the eye that has brains, I'm making a point about marriage. For you see, marriage is a lot like an orange. First, you have the skin. Then the sweet, sweet innards. Mmm...
Oh, I told Marge this wouldn't work the other night in bed.
No, that's not what I meant. Marge and I always talk things over in bed. Like the other night, we were having a fight about money.
I was telling Marge that we could save some money if she only died her hair once a month.
Oh yeah, she's been as gray as a mule since she was seventeen.
I went on for hours, and they were hanging on my every word. I really think I was born to teach.
Aah!
Marge, I didn't tell 'em personal stuff.
Oh. You mean about you. Well, maybe I said some things, some personal things. But you should have seen them, Marge, they really wanted to hear what I had to say.
Look Marge, you don't know what it's like - I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order! The whole freaking system is out of order! You want the truth? You want the truth? You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do!! Forget it Marge, it's Chinatown!!!
(sheepishly) Yes ma'am.
What is a wedding? Well, Webster's Dictionary defines a wedding as 'the process of removing weeds from one's garden'.
This is a place of learning, not a place of... hearing about things.
No wait! Uh, wait, yes! I do have a story about two other young married's.
Now the wife of this couple has an interesting quirk in the bedroom. It seems she goes wild with desire if her husband nibbles on her elbow.
Well, let's just call them... uh, 'Mr. X' and 'Mrs. Y'. So anyway, Mr. X would say, "Marge, if this doesn't get your motor running, my name isn't Homer J. Simpson!"
Not tonight, Marge. Tonight, we can eat a nice leisurely dinner at home.
Marge, you'll never guess what! My whole class is here! They're going to observe the human peepshow that is our lives.
So, little Lisa, apple of my eye, how were things down at the old school house?
(to Bart) And how's my little major-leaguer? Catch any June bugs today?
Son, I know you meant well, but that wasn't the right thing to do.
Why you little...!
He he he. Well, now that the little ones have toddled off to bed--
All right, we're breaking early tonight, class. For tomorrow, you should read pages seven through eighteen in Lisa's diary.
Huh?
But I'm not in the cla--
Come on, Marge, let me in! There's crickets out here!
Okay, Marge, things were said, mistakes were made. Let's end this madness and get on with our lives.
But I've learned my lesson. It'll never happen again.
Aw, Marge is throwing me out for blabbing about her elbow thing.
Honey, the door blew shut! (pause) Oh, fine. If that's what you want, you've got it. This scene is gettin' old, man. I'm hittin' the road! Maybe I'll drop you a line someday from wherever I end up in this crazy old world.
Don't mind me, boys, just scrubbing my undies.
Keep up the roughhousing, son! Without a strong male presence in the house, you could turn sissy overnight! (in a sissy voice) Oh, these stubborn grass stains.
Oh, good. Reverend Lovejoy will make Marge take me back! He has to push the sanctity of marriage, or his God will punish him.
Good night, Marge.
Oh, why didn't I take a picture? I had ten years to take a picture!
I love you... Will you marry me, Marge?... You mean I'm going to be a daddy?... I hope we'll always be together... together... together...
Together?
Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow!
Good news, Lisa! I don't need your mother anymore. I've created a replacement for her that's superior to her in almost every way!
Lisa! You will respect your new mother! Now, give her a kiss. Kiss her!
Aah! Oh my god oh my god oh my god! (calmly) All right, let's get our stories straight - she tripped, right?
Ah, your flesh mother used to bring me pudding. Oh, I miss Marge. Lisa you're smart, help me trick her into taking me back!
I'll pay you forty dollars if you think of it for me.
Okay... thirty.
All right,, brain, it's all up to you. If you don't think of what it is, we'll lose Marge forever.
Eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding eat the pudding.
Okay. But then we gotta get to work.
Moe! What are you doing here?
Bye, Moe.
Marge, I finally figured out what I can give you that no one else can - a bouquet of po -- (sees Moe's bouquet) oh! I give up. I don't deserve to live with you.
Oh... my tattered rags are caught on your coffee table.
Wait a minute. Wait, that's it! I know now what I can offer you that no one else can - complete and utter dependence!!
Are you kidding? It's a wondrous, marvelous thing. Marge, I need you more than anyone else on this entire planet could possibly ever need you! I need you to take care of me, to put up with me, and most of all I need you to love me, 'cause I love you.
Marge, look at me! We've been separated for a day, and I'm as dirty as a Frenchman. In another few hours I'll be dead! I can't afford to lose your trust again.
Wait till my class hears about this! Kidding!
Ah! Oh, it's great to be indoors with my family.
Hey, this is dated two weeks ago!
Special present? I don't want to wait! I want it now, I want the children to see-- oh! Oh, right, later, he he.
Hey Moe.
And then I sped away without anyone seeing my license plate.
Yeah... 'cept I forgot to go to work.
Will you all stop worrying about that stupid comet? It's going to be destroyed, didn't you hear what that guy in the building said?
Ah-ah! Lisa, the whole reason we have elected officials is so we don't have to think all the time. Just like that rainforest scare a few years back. Our officials saw there was a problem and they fixed it, didn't they?
Ah-ah! There's that word again.
Well, then I have a backup plan. See, while the unprepared are still sitting around twiddling their thumbs and going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do- do- do- do- do, do- do- do- do...
I'm getting to that! So anyway, they're going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do...
So anyway, we get in our car and take the bridge out of town, while all the while they're still going (twiddling his thumbs and humming) do- do- do- do- do, do- do- do- do...
All right!
It's times like this I wish I were a religious man.
(writing the names down) Just a second... (Marge turns the television off) What's everyone so worked up about? So there's a comet, big deal. It'll burn up in our atmosphere and what's ever left will be no bigger than a Chihuahua's head.
Of course I'm right. If I'm not, may we all be horribly crushed from above somehow. (everyone groans) Okay, if you're that worried about it, let's go down to the bomb shelter.
Homer Simpson takes care of his family. (cut to Homer banging on a door) Flanders! Open up!
Get out of there. My family needs to use your bomb shelter.
No deal, out!
An hour? I can't wait another hour. What's keeping that stupid comet? (someone bangs on the door) Ah, there it is.
(struggling) I can't get the... I can't get the door closed. Somebody's going to have to get out.
Uh, yeah... I can do that...
Wait a minute! We all know the one thing we won't need in the future! Left-handed stores. That's you, Flanders! (aside to Rod and Todd) I'm terribly story. (aloud) Flanders is the only useless person here. If anyone dies, it should be him. (aside) I'm sorry, please forgive me. (aloud) So let's kick Flanders out. (aside) Sorry.
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it! Stop it! I can't take this any more. I can't let that brave man out there die alone. I'm surprised and disgusted by all of you! Especially his
children. I'm going out there! (he goes out, slamming the door behind him, then puts his head back round the door) And it was a baby ox!
I know, kids. I'm scared too!
T.G.I.F.! Guys, I'm off to Moe's.
Don't worry, I have a plan. I saw this in a movie about a bus that had to SPEED around the city, keeping its SPEED over fifty. And if its SPEED dropped, it would explode. I think it was called... "The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down." First, I hook this common VCR into the security camera system like so, then I insert this old videotape of us working on a continuous loop. (The tape from the 1970's has Homer eating donuts in a "Sit On It" T-shirt, and talking to Lenny. Then, the tape abruptly cuts to Lenny doing a Saturday Night Fever style move - flares and all)
Nah, it's Friday night, Moe. I want to try something special.
Goal! (takes a sip) Wait a minute, this is Duff!
Mmm...bold, refreshing, and something I can't quite put my finger on.
Well, it's 1am. Better go home and spend some quality time with the kids.
Uh, I guess I'll walk home. (walks out, swaying) Ohh...
No time for you, old man!
Please, don't hurt me!
Yahhh!
It was an alien, Marge! It appeared in front of me and said, "Don't be afraid"!
No! Well, ten beers.
I'm telling you, I saw a creature from another planet.
Oh yeah? Well when I came to I was covered with a sticky, translucent goo. Explain that!
So?
Ahhh! Oh, it's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked, by my own children...on my birthday.
Yes! Remember? It's the same day as the dog's.
Lousy loveable dog.
Oh, it was awful. They sat me on a cold, metal table and prodded me with humiliating probes. And--oh, wait, that was my physical.
The alien has a sweet heavenly voice...like Urkel! And he appears every Friday night...like Urkel!
Ugh, you don't have to humiliate me.
No, I'm sorry.
Yes! (The machine blows up)
Ow!
Well, the evening began at the Gentleman's club, where we were discussing Wittgenstein over a game of backgammon.
We were sitting in Barney's car eating packets of mustard. Ya happy?
(Several beers later) You are one fine looking woman, lady. If I wasn't married, I'd go out with you like that! (stamps bottle on bar, and it fizzes over) I am so sorry. Whatever you do, don't tell Marge. God I love her! Hey, a penny! (Dives to grab it)
(Even more drunk) So I said, blue M&M, red M&M, they all wind up the same colour in the end.
(In the forest) I was standing right here, when the horrible creature emerged from the woods.
Oh Marge, I've never felt so alone. No one believes me. (pause) Uh, this is the part where you're supposed to say, "I believe you, Homer."
You do! Oh Marge, you've made me so happy!
Thanks, I'd love an omelette right about now.
No, I can't. This is my cause. I'm like the man who single-handedly built the rocket and went to the moon. What was his name? Apollo 3?
No, I refuse to share a bed with someone who thinks I'm crazy. Unless you're feeling... amorous. Rrrr!
Well then, good night.
Oh, I suppose you're going to mock me too.
You do?
Thank you son. And do you think you can stop the casual swearing?
That's my boy. If you believe in me, then I'm not going to give up. I'll prove I'm right. This Friday we're going back to the woods and we're going to find that alien!
We'll fake it and sell it to the Fox network.
Now son, they do a lot of quality programming too. (Pause, then they both laugh hard) I kill me.
Now son, you don't want to drink beer. That's for daddies and kids with fake ID's. Besides, it's such a beautiful night, how about a ghost story?
No! No! Nooo!!
Yeah, me too.
It's him!
As a representative of Planet Earth, let me be the first to say... (Steps in the camp fire) Ahhh! (screams more)
D'oh! It's gone. And we still don't have any proof.
Good work son! We did it! We did it!
Marge, kids, they're about to show my videotape! (everyone rushes in)
Uh, I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the alien. Any questions at all. Dr Hibbert?
Uh, the second one. Zillophone. Next question.
Uh, yes.
This interview is over! (Slams door, and the weather vane falls)
Take a look at this Lisa. (Holds up 'Homer Was Right' T-Shirt) You don't see any "Homer Is A Dope" T-shirts, do you?
D'oh! (Marge and Maggie are wearing "Homer is a Dope" shirts) Marge, how could you?
I'll take two.
Look. There it is!
Thanks, Marge.
Yeah, hi, Roy. Hey, there having open casting for the voice of Poochie.
I do not!
I prefer to listen to Cheap Trick.
Hey, this is Homer Simpson saying howdy to all the girls out there in radio land. (Bart plays back the tape) Ah! I don't sound like that, do I? Oh... I don't like having such a hilarious voice.
(clears throat) Ruff, ruff! I'm Poochie, the rockin' dog!
(angrily) Oh, no attitude, eh? Not in your face, huh? Well, you can cram it with walnuts, ugly!
(sheepishly) Huh? I can't, I don't remember what I did.
(sarcastically) Oh, I don't get the job, do I? Well boo-hoo! I don't get to be a cartoon dog!
Oh, now I've got the job, huh? (realizing) Oh, thank you.
She smells sheep smells by the sheet shtore. Wait, wait. Let me try it again.
You? But you're a lady!
(laughing) Hey, it really is you! How'd you get to be so good?
You mean "meep-meep"?
Uh, I guess. Is this episode going on the air live?
I'll field that one. Let me ask you a question. Why would a man whose shirt says "Genius at Work" spend all of his time watching a children's cartoon show?
What the hell are you talking about?
Quiet! You're missing the jokes!
So, what did everybody think?
So, it was pretty okay, huh?
Well, at least I liked it. Didn't I? (pan up to brain)
D'oh...
I'm the worst Poochie ever.
Uh, hi, Mr. Meyers. I've been doing some thinking, and I've got some ideas to improve the show. I got it right here. (pulls out a piece of paper) One, Poochie needs to be louder, angrier, and have access to a time machine. Two, whenever Poochie's not onscreen, all the other characters should be asking "Where's Poochie"? Three--
Then they said they were going to kill Poochie off!
You're right Marge. it's not my fault. I won't let them treat Poochie like dirt anymore just because he's the new guy.
Put a sock in it, Roy.
No, I am not.
Never! (He tears he script in half,the writers gasp) You can't just kill of a classic TV character. Poochie could be bigger than curly fries. But first he has to win back the audience. That's why I'm going to read these lines I wrote myself with my own two hands.
(as Poochie) Yes, I certainly do! (normal voice) Hello there, Itchy. I know there's a lot of people who don't like me and wish I would go away. I think we got off on the wrong foot. I know I can come off a little proactive, and for that I'm sorry. But if everyone could find a place in their hearts for the little dog that nobody wanted, I know we can make them laugh and cry until we grow old together.
Now kids, I know you loved the old Poochie, but the new one is going to be better than ten Super Bowls! I don't want to oversell it, judge for yourself.
Hey that wasn't supposed to happen. Those finks double-crossed me.
Well, I guess I learned my lesson. The thing is, I lost creative control of the project. And I forgot to ask for any money. Well, live learn.
I... don't know.
Oh, I've never heard of those people.
Woohoo!
Yes, yes! Oh god, yes!!
Oh, I'll kill myself if Portugal doesn't win.
Boring!
But I wanna do some rioting! (he pushes one of the Scotsmen)
All done!
Relax, Marge, if someone tries to get in here, my burglar alarm will let us know.
(relaxed) Watch the fish, Marge.
What did I tell ya, Marge?
Oh, let's get that.
Let's get that - the suffocation thing.
Five hundred dollars? Aw, forget it.
I wouldn't have thought so either, but here we are.
I couldn't agree more Marjory. You deserve piece of mind, and piece of mind is what you shall have.
I'd like to buy your deadliest gun, please.
I don't have to be careful, I got a gun.
Oh, yeah.
Baby.
Mm-hmm.
Oh...
Ooh, I like the sound of that!
Oh, I don't need anything like that... yet... Just give me my gun.
Five days? But I'm mad now! I'd kill you if I had my gun.
Lousy big shot, thinks he's so big 'cause he's got a lot of guns, well if he didn't have any guns I'd show him a thing or two. (At home that night, he is still muttering , as he paces up and down the hallway.) Let's see him walk into my store and then we'll see who's worried about five-day waiting periods...
Marge kicked me out.
(still muttering) Pushy kids, think they can tell me what to do in my house, well I tell you, parents these days, they don't know how to rear children...
Oh, how am I supposed to last five days without shooting something?
Come on, come on, open up!
Ah! That's the stuff! (He comes back out into the store.) Now, I believe you have some sort of firearm for me.
Yeah.
Oh heh heh, yeah.
Former President.
"Potentially dangerous"?
Woo hoo!
Close your eyes, Marge, I have a surprise for you!
Okay, open you're eyes!
It's a handgun! Isn't it great? This is the trigger, and this is the thing you point at whatever you want to die--
I thought Smithers did it.
Only if you clean your room.
TV said that? But I have to have a gun! It's in the Constitution!
You couldn't be more wrong, Lisa. If I didn't have this gun, the King of England could just walk in here any time he wants, and start shoving you around. (he starts pushing Lisa) Do you want that? Huh? Do you?
All right then.
A gun is not a weapon, Marge, it's a tool. Like a butcher knife or a harpoon, or, uh... or an alligator. You just need more education on the subject. Tell you what - you come with me to an NRA meeting, and if you still don't think guns are great, we'll argue some more.
Learning something, Marge?
Hi, I'm Homer S.
Hi. It seems to me, if a gun can protect something as important as a bar, it's good enough to protect my family. So if you'll have me, I would like to become a lifetime member of your wonderful organization.
Aw, come on, be fair Marge! For once in your life, be fair!
Sorry!
What? Oh, Apu, I would never...
Or would I? I've already gone this far. I wonder what my life would be like if I robbed the Kwik-E-Mart?
I'll do it! I'll rob the Kwik-E-Mart! All right, put your--
D'oh! Oh well, I'll rob it next time.
Sure thing, honey.
Want me to get the cat down?
Pull!
See you in Hell, dinner plate!
Mmm... you probably left them at work. On another topic, guess who was picked to host the next NRA get together?
You said the breakfast table!
Listen, if it'll make you feel any better, I'll put the safety on. (he flicks the safety, but the gun still fires) Whoops. Guess it was already on. (he flicks it again, and the gun fires again) Uh, I'd... better just put it down...
All right, Marge, I'll do it. For you.
And I'm a wonderful man.
Oh, I see Bart gets to have a gun.
I put it in a safe place, Marge! I mean, what are the odds the boy would look in the vegetable crisper?
But Marge, I swear to you, I never thought you'd find out!
So this is the thanks I get for protecting my family? Then go. I'll be just fine. (aside, to Milhouse) Do you know how to cook dinner?
Ooh, the gun club's gonna be here any minute! (the doorbell rings) Oh! They're here. They're here!
Here's some more chocolate curls, gun buddies.
Anyone else want a beer?
I use it for everything! Watch me turn on the TV.
Yeah, but--
Oh...
I didn't get one yet!
Oh, this gun cost me everything - my wife, my kids... everything but my precious, precious gun. (he shoots out the last light) This stinks. I want my family back!
Marge? (a man grumbles) Sorry. Marge? (a woman screams) Sorry. Marge?
Sorry.
Oh, Marge! There's so many things I wanna yell to you!
Okay!!
Oh, honey, please come home. I need you! It's dark in the house and I'm hungry and lonesome, and there's no one there to hear my various witty remarks!
It's gone for good, Marge. I finally realized, what's the point of having a gun for protection, if you've got no one to protect?
Freeze, bad guy!
I know I said that. But what I secretly meant was--
The jokes on you, buddy. There's no bullets in that thing. (he hold up a box) Ha ha!
Okay, don't shoot!
I'm sorry I lied to you, Marge. But this gun had a hold on me. I felt this incredible surge of power, like God must feel when he's holding a gun. So please, get rid of it, because I know I'll just lie to you again and again!
Yeah, he's my favorite fictional character.
Woo hoo!
Quiet. God looks like he has something important to say.
Ah, can't make it in today, Mr. Smithers! I have smallpox! ...Well, it wasn't wiped out in MY house!
Water bill, third notice. Jury duty, third notice. Mortgage bill.. ooh, second notice!
Flancrest Enterprises?
You liar! You don't have a home business, why would you make up a lie like that?
(smooth) Internet, eh?
(smooth) Scratch, eh?
(smooth) Maude, eh?
No time to answer that, Marge. I'm setting up a home office for my new business enterprise.
Ever hear of a little thing called the Internet?
Oh yeah. Everybody's making money off the Internet except us. We've fallen behind. WAY behind.
Can't discuss that now, Marge! I have to write another delicious memo!
Mmm... memo.
Oh, what am I gonna call my Internet company? All the good names are taken. Oh wait, I've got it! Flancrest Enterprises! (looks in a book) D'oh!
This industry moves so fast it's really hard to tell. That's why I need a name that's cutting-edge, like CutCo, EdgeCom, InterSlice... come on, Marge, you're good at these! Help me out!
Fine, it's not important... What really matters is my title. I think I'll make myself... vice president. (excitedly) No, wait! Junior vice president!
CompuGlobalHyperMegaNet, junior vice president Homer Simpson speaking, how may I direct your call? (disappointedly) It's Patty.
Welcome to the Internet, my friend, how can I help you?
Can I have some money now?
Oh, they have the Internet on computers now!
Bill Gates?! Millionaire computer nerd Bill Gates! Oh my god. Oh my god. Get out of sight, Marge. I don't want this to look like a two-bit operation.
You don't look so rich.
(quietly to Marge) Get a load of the bowl-job, Marge!
This is it Marge. I've poured my heart and soul into this business and now it's finally paying off. (covering his mouth) We're rich! Richer than astronauts.
(to Gates) I reluctantly accept your proposal!
Hey, what the hell's going on!
Mail call! Gather 'round, everyone! All right, one for... resident.
Well, that's it.
I needed my power fix. (sighs with pleasure)
Yeah, quit stalling, Marge, we want our reward.
Oh man, it feels good to get out of that car. Ooh, go-karts! Come on, everybody, let's go!
Hehehehe, Look at me, Bart! I'm driving!
Stand back and watch the pro.
Nah, they mess up my hair.
Ooh, ball one. (he misses again) Ball two. This bozo's gonna walk me. (ball hits him on the head) Hey! You're goin' down, you-- (hit) d'oh! (hit) why you-- (hit) ow!!
Okay, I rolled up all the socks, what's next?
All right... oh, I hate folding sheets.
Well, whatever it is, it's a two man job. Where's Bart?
It's okay, Marge, I'll get him. (yelling very loudly) Bart!!!
(leaning out the window and yelling even louder) MILHOUSE!!!
TELL BART TO COME HOME!!!
WHO'S NELSON?!!
(giving Lisa some money) Alright young lady, I want you to march yourself directly to the Kwik-E-Mart and get me some chips and a beer! (he pauses then gives her more money.) Get a little something for your self, honey.
D'oh!
I don't know. Drug lab?
Or reading comic books, what am I, Kreskin? You tell me what he's doing.
Oh man, this is the most exiting thing I've ever seen since Hailey's comet collided with the moon.
Sure it didn't...
Ooh, how about cherry this time? And would it kill ya to make some coffee?
Why's it taking so long? Bart was born in about five minutes.
Really? Well, the time just flew by, didn't it?
I see a horn!
Oh, hehehehehe, you look like a little tiny dinosaur. (He touches one, and it bites his finger.) Aah! This is one vicious baby bird.
Enough bickering! I know how to settle this.
Aw... (takes the pie) if anybody wants me, I'll be eating alone in the basement.
I'm proud of you boy. (sniffs candle) Mmm... loganberry.
Five? Why don't we make it fifty?
Ho ho, you're going to regret this!
Wow, the absorbed odors of a million meals. (He eats a spoonful of it.) So many flavors! All those tasty memories flooding back! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Son, I know it hurts. I still remember my first lifetime banning.
But I can still see your movies, right?
(he sniffs) And I never saw Gallagher again.
Tom Savini?
Don't worry your spiky little head. I've got it all planned out.
You're right! Give me a minute. Hmm...
For once in my life, I'm tall! Don't take that away from me!
(in a posh voice) Hello, I'm Shaquille O'Neal. Let us in, please.
I'm sorry, son.
No problem.
Woo! Dinner!
I love the theatre.
Now, when you've got a bum ticker like we do, you need all the friends you can get. And Moe's is the friendliest place in the rum district.
Aw, be nice Moe, This guy just got out of the hospital.
Come on! You're here to make friends.
Oh, I can't decide! I throw myself upon the mercy of the food court!
(at a different stall) And I'll have the Beef Wellington.
(looks at food) Eh, same old garbage!
(picking up corn) This corn doesn't look so big.
(shocked) Wha-aat!?
Aah! Aah! (runs off) I'll regroup at Red Lobster...
You ain't pretty no more...
Ah, look, I've made some friends. Now go do my bidding! Uh, whatever it may be.
So Lisa says by killing their enemy I became the alpha crow.
I'm sure he'll turn up. Look here's one of his buttons (holds up a button, dripping with blood)
That's Russel Crowe, Cameron Crow, Crow Diddly, Jim Crow-nan, Gregory Peck...
It's a murder, honey. A group of crows is called a murder.
Drop it in, don't cram it in! Oh forget it, I'll do it myself. (looks up to Maggie's bedroom window) Ah, look, Maggie wants to fly too! (the crows fly into the room and pick her up) Hey, cut it out! Put her down!
Oh, thank God you're okay! (puts her down and turns to the crows) Okay, that was not cool! We need to lay down some ground rules. (the crows squawk) We'll get to that, right now I think we need some time apart. (crows squawk more) Alright that's it! (picks up broom) Shoo you stupid crows! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!
That is not a worm! (screams some more)
Ow, ow! I hate getting stitches in my eyes! Stupid crows.
(calmly) Hmm, fascinating. Say, Doctor, can you do something about my (hysterical) SEARING PAIN!?
Does it go in the butt?
Look man, I don't do drugs.
I had a bad experience with drugs. It was that golden weekend between summer school and regular school.
For me, the sixties ended that day in 1978.
But isn't marijuana, or "dope", illegal?
Okay, lets see... (reads container) "Toke as needed. Caution: objects may appear more edible than they actually are."
Smoke on the water! Da da da, da da da-da...
They burned down the gambling house,
It died with an awful sound.
I am hungry for a candy bar,
I think I'll eat a Mounds."
Marge, it's making my eyes better. And it's legal. I could walk up to the President and blow smoke in his stupid monkey face, and he'd just have to sit there groovin' on it!
Marge, I just realized, I am the "ow", in the word "now". And if you tell anyone...
Hey, it's me. I got Marge on the other line and she is totally bumming me out.
I didn't, but now, Daddy's special medicine... (menacingly) which you must never use, because it will ruin you life! (calmly) ... lets Daddy see and hear magical things that you will never experience... (menacingly) ever!
Shh! Shh! Shh!
(thinking) Wow, that saxophone would make a great pipe.
Oh my God, this dude does the best Flanders. You got the moustache, and the "diddly"... okay, now do Wiggum.
Oh right, the God dude. Hey, I got a question for you. (pulls out a piece of paper) "Could Jesus microwave a burrito so hot that he himself could not eat it?"
Now you know what I've been going through.
Oh man, this is long. Could you read it to me?
Whoa. Whoa. God does so much for me and he doesn't ask anything in return.
(signs it) Done and done. Now do Wiggum!
I said Wiggum!
Whoops, I though this was the can, man. (laughs)
You just said it! (laughs again)
(touches Burns face) You're covered with a very fine fuzz.
Hehehe, hardly working...
Whoa! One question at a time! (points to Marge) Yes, you?
Yeah? Well I got news for you. I just got promoted and it's all thanks to "yes I cann-abis". (walks off screen) We have a kitchen?!
Look at shemp! He is so high!
And "Otto" is "Otto" backwards! (laughs)
As soon as I graduate I am so outa here!
We gotta get out and stop that initiative! Marge, I'm gonna need ten thousand veggie burritos.
Good afternoon. I wanna thank you all for coming down here, taking time off from your jobs... (crowd all mutter "Jobs?") Cause we need to keep medical marijuana legal! (crowd cheer) Whether you suffer from glaucoma, or you just rented The Matrix, medical marijuana can make things fabulous! ...medically. (crowd cheer) So my mellow fellow citizens, when you go into that voting booth on Tuesday the 7th...
Oh man, they already voted! And we lost! (crowd groan) Oh man I can't believe we spaced on the date!
Well we can't just stand here staring at our hands. Although... (looks at hands) Wow!
Oh, I could have smoked that pot... and worn that hair.
Eyes? What the Hell are you talking about?
Alright, I'll do it for my kids.
Never!
Get out.
Oh yeah... (chuckling) Get out.
Going cold turkey isn't as delicious a it sounds.
It's been three days and my mind is clearer. My sperm count is up, and I'm able to recognize simple shape and patterns.
Unregardless, I will no longer be a slave to this. (pulls out a joint)
As a reminder, Marge.
Hello?
But I can't find you funny anymore.
This stuff can make anything funny, even that show that follows Friends. But I promised my family I wouldn't smoke it anymore.
Start inhalin', Waylon.
You mean that guy on "60 Minutes" who yells all the time?
Oh man, we killed Mr. Burns! Mr. Burns is gonna be so mad!
So what? Mr. Burns is dead!
Bill Clinton, everyone! He's Jimmy Carter with a fox attitude. And now a man who you will see as definitely... not dead... Mr. Montgomery Burns!
Mr. Burns, as we're running long, may we skip you speech and go directly to the questions?
Mr. Burns, may I field that one? (Burns nods and smiles) It's true we're losing money. But there's no reason we can't dance, dance, dance the night away!
Mr. Burns has left the building!
(to Smithers) And you wanted to take him to the hospital.
